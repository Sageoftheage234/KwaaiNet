# KwaaiNet Player Journey
## From Invitation to Architect — a Game Design Framework

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-05-04  
**Status:** Product Design — v1 draft

---

## Design Principles

KwaaiNet's user progression borrows deliberately from game design:

- **Every action has a visible reward.** XP, a new badge, a higher trust tier, a new capability unlocked.
- **The next objective is always clear.** At every level, the player knows exactly what to do next and why it matters.
- **Progress is permanent.** Verifiable Credentials in the wallet are the on-chain equivalent of achievements — they travel with the player across restarts, device changes, and network migrations.
- **The network effect is the game.** The platform gets more valuable as more players reach higher levels. Inviting others and endorsing peers are first-class game actions.
- **No level is a dead end.** Each level is genuinely useful on its own; higher levels add power, not just status.

## Level 0 — Visitor

> *"You've been invited to a different kind of AI."*

### Entry
- Receives an invitation link, or discovers KwaaiNet organically.
- No account, no install, no commitment.

### Experience
- **Browser-only.** The Kwaai web app runs a lightweight WASM inference node directly in the browser tab — no server required.
- Can send prompts to the distributed network and receive responses.
- Sees the live network map at map.kwaai.ai — nodes by location, throughput, trust tier.
- Sees a "shadow profile": *"Your device could contribute approximately X tok/s to the network."*
- Every response carries a footnote: which nodes served the inference, their trust tier, and whether vectors left the network.

### Objectives
| # | Objective | XP |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 1 | Send your first inference request | 5 XP |
| 2 | View the network map | 5 XP |
| 3 | Explore your shadow profile | 5 XP |
| 4 | Read your first inference provenance receipt | 5 XP |

### Rewards
- 20 XP (enough to see progress toward Level 1)
- Unlocks: invitation code to share with one other person

### Boss Moment — the gate to Level 1
**Register a PassKey.** One tap with Face ID / Touch ID / Windows Hello. No email, no password.

### What stops players here
- Don't yet understand why a node matters.
- Friction: "I just want to try the AI, not run infrastructure."
- **Design response:** The shadow profile is the hook — show them concretely what their machine could do, and what they'd earn for doing it. The invite they can give a friend is a social hook.

---

## Level 1 — Member

> *"You exist on the network. Your AI remembers you."*

### Entry
- Completed PassKey registration.
- Has a persistent session identity (FIDO2 credential, device-bound or cloud-synced).

### Experience
- Personal AI: conversation history persists across sessions (stored locally, encrypted with PassKey-derived key).
- Can configure privacy level: Anonymous → Basic → Personalized.
- Appears on map.kwaai.ai with a placeholder node badge (grey, "Member — not yet running a node").
- Can earn XP by using the AI — inference requests contribute to the network's collective usage signal.
- Receives a `MemberVC` issued by the Kwaai platform on PassKey verification.

### Objectives
| # | Objective | XP |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 1 | Complete 10 inference sessions | 10 XP |
| 2 | Configure your privacy level | 10 XP |
| 3 | Check your trust wallet (`kwaainet identity show`) | 10 XP |
| 4 | Invite one friend (they must reach Level 1) | 50 XP |
| 5 | Attend a Kwaai Personal AI Summit (earns `SummitAttendeeVC`) | 100 XP |

### Rewards
- 50–180 XP depending on objectives completed
- `MemberVC` in wallet (+0.05 trust score weight)
- `SummitAttendeeVC` on summit attendance (+0.10 trust score weight)
- Access to longer context windows (vs anonymous Level 0)
- Unlock: install guide + setup wizard becomes available

### Boss Moment — the gate to Level 2
**Install `kwaainet`, run `kwaainet setup`, start the daemon, and appear on map.kwaai.ai.**

### What stops players here
- "Installing software feels like work."
- **Design response:** The setup wizard (from `NODE_UI_PLANNING.md`) does it in 4 clicks. The boss moment is celebrated with a confetti animation and a map notification: *"Your node just went live."*

---

## Level 2 — Citizen

> *"You are the network. Your node serves your community."*

### Entry
- `kwaainet` installed, daemon running, node visible on map.kwaai.ai.

### Experience
- Node appears on the map with a **blue Citizen badge**.
- Can see live stats: tokens served, uptime %, peers connected, trust score.
- **VPK Bob role**: private knowledge base active. Documents encrypted locally before leaving the device; query results return only IDs and scores, never raw content.
- Participates in distributed inference as a **consumer** — requests route preferentially through higher-trust nodes.
- 24-hour uptime earns first `UptimeVC` (provisional, reissued daily).

### XP Sources (ongoing)
| Action | XP rate |
|--------|---------|
| Node online | 1 XP / hour |
| Inference request served (even small) | 1 XP / 50 tokens served |
| 24h continuous uptime | 25 XP bonus |
| 7-day streak (node online ≥ 20h/day) | 100 XP bonus |
| First `UptimeVC` earned | 50 XP |

### Objectives
| # | Objective | XP |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 1 | Stay online for 72 continuous hours | 75 XP |
| 2 | Serve your first 10,000 tokens | 200 XP |
| 3 | Enable VPK (`kwaainet vpk enable --mode bob`) | 25 XP |
| 4 | Endorse one peer (`kwaainet identity endorse <peer_id>`) | 25 XP |
| 5 | Reach trust tier **Known** (score ≥ 0.10) | 50 XP |

### Rewards
- `UptimeVC` (provisional → permanent after 30 days, +0.10 trust weight)
- Map badge upgrades to **blue Citizen**
- Unlock: shard serving configuration in the UI
- Eligible for: inference circuit priority routing

### Boss Moment — the gate to Level 3
**Serve 100,000 tokens over at least 30 days of uptime. Earn `ThroughputVC`.**

### What stops players here
- Node goes offline when the laptop closes.
- **Design response:** "Always-on" setup guide (systemd / launchd / Windows service), surfaced prominently in the dashboard when uptime drops. UI shows: *"You're 3 days of uptime away from your ThroughputVC."*

---

## Level 3 — Contributor

> *"The network is stronger because you're in it."*

### Entry

## Trust Score — the in-game stat

XP is the progression metric. The **trust score** (0.0 – 1.0) is the in-game stat peers see and rely on. They are related but not the same: XP accumulates monotonically; trust score can decay if uptime falls or credentials age out.

```
trust_score = α × score_vc + (1 − α) × score_metrics

score_vc = min(1.0, Σ weight(vc_type) × 0.5^(age_days / 365))
```

### VC weights (contribution to trust score)
| VC | Weight | Issued by |
|----|--------|-----------|
| `FiduciaryPledgeVC` | +0.30 | GliaNet Foundation |
| `VerifiedNodeVC` | +0.25 | Kwaai Foundation |
| `ThroughputVC` | +0.20 | Peer-witnessed, co-signed |
| `UptimeVC` | +0.10 | Bootstrap servers |
| `SummitAttendeeVC` | +0.10 | Kwaai Foundation |
| `PeerEndorsementVC` | +0.05 each (cap 0.20) | Any Contributor+ node |
| `MemberVC` | +0.05 | Kwaai platform |

### Trust tiers (used in routing)
| Score | Tier | Routing eligibility |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| ≥ 0.70 | **Trusted** | Enterprise, HIPAA/GDPR, Eve storage |
| ≥ 0.40 | **Verified** | Priority routing, circuits |
| ≥ 0.10 | **Known** | General inference |
| < 0.10 | **Unknown** | Basic consumer only |

---

## The Invite Graph

Every player has an **invite code**. When someone uses your code and reaches Level 1, you earn XP. When they advance further, you earn again. This creates a visible lineage on the player profile:

```
You (Guardian, 28,000 XP)
├── Alice (Contributor, 7,200 XP)   +250 XP earned from Alice's Level 3
│   └── Dave (Citizen, 800 XP)     +100 XP earned from Dave's Level 2
└── Bob (Member, 120 XP)            +50 XP earned from Bob's Level 1
```

The invite graph is public and visible on map.kwaai.ai. Architects with large, deep invite trees have visible network impact — the leaderboard shows both personal XP and "network XP" (sum of your subtree).

## Open Questions for v2

1. **XP decay** — Should XP decay if a node goes offline for extended periods, or should it be a permanent ledger with a separate "active score"?
2. **PHE milestone** — When the PHE encryption layer ships (Phase 2), Eve operators who upgrade should receive a one-time `PHEUpgradeVC` and XP bonus for being early.
3. **Level 0 inference quality** — Should anonymous browser-only inference be throttled (e.g. shorter context, slower priority) to create genuine pull toward Level 1?
4. **Paid tier** — Is there a "fast lane" where organisations pay to get a `VerifiedNodeVC` without the 30-day uptime requirement? If so, does that VC carry lower trust weight?
5. **Sybil resistance** — A player could create many low-effort nodes to farm uptime XP. Mitigation: `VerifiedNodeVC` requires human onboarding; `FiduciaryPledgeVC` requires a legal entity. XP from unverified nodes is capped at Citizen level rewards.
6. **Mobile** — Level 0 works on mobile today (browser). A lightweight mobile node (background inference contributor) could sit between Level 0 and Level 1 — worth a half-level?
