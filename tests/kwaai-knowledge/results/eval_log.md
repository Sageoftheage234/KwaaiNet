**Flags:** smart mode, biographical-expansion, model=llama3.1:8b, metro-linux p2p

**Changes since r50 (199/225 = 88.4%):** same code+graph as r50, fresh LLM run (+3 pts non-det)

**Per-question:** Q01:3, Q02:3, Q03:6, Q04:4, Q05:8, Q06:2, Q07:3, Q08:5, Q09:9, Q10:7, Q11:6, Q12:6, Q13:6, Q14:5, Q15:6, Q16:6, Q17:5, Q18:6, Q19:5, Q20:4, Q21:5, Q22:4, Q23:5, Q24:7, Q25:3, Q26:6, Q27:4, Q28:5, Q29:4, Q30:4, Q31:5, Q32:5, Q33:5, Q34:6, Q35:4, Q36:6, Q37:7, Q38:4, Q39:5, Q40:3

**Key finding:** Q06 (Buitencingle) = 2/8 for 2nd consecutive run — not non-det, but systematic.
Root cause: "7 Buitencingle Street" entity description (YAML) is missing: Dutch, belt, cobbled,
palm trees, No. 7, grandfather. LLM cannot output keywords not in the injected entity.
Fix: enriched entity description for r52 rebuild.

**Still broken:**
- q06 (2/8): systematic — entity description sparse; fix in YAML for r52
- q20 (4/5): "District Six" missing — front-loaded in Kismets description for r52
- q30 (4/6): Gujarat/Joosub consistently missing — front-loaded in Haji Joosub description for r52

**Flags:** smart mode, biographical-expansion, model=llama3.1:8b, metro-linux p2p

**Changes since r49b (198/225 = 88.0%):** +1 pt (Q14+2, Q20+2 fixed; Q06/Q29/Q40 LLM non-det regression)
- **Code (retriever.rs)**: geo-stop filter (`["south","africa","african","cape","town"]`) for name_overlap scoring — Q37 Gandhi routing fixed
- **Code (retriever.rs)**: seeded-entity tiebreaker — pre-computed sort key gives YAML entities (conf=1.0) priority over EE-extracted ties
- **Code (retriever.rs)**: lenient desc threshold 40→100 chars — excludes short EE fragments like "Yorkshire Cricket Club: 88 chars" from injection
- **YAML**: District Six aliases — "Ben District Six", "District Six Museum", "District Six: Lest we Forget", "Lest we Forget" merged into canonical
- **YAML**: Kismets aliases — "Orient Cricket Club", "Indian Cricket Union Vic", "WPICU", "West Indian Cricket", "Yorkshire Cricket Club" merged into Kismets

## r49b — 2026-06-18 07:26 — **88.0% (198.0/225)** (superseded by r50)

**Flags:** smart mode, biographical-expansion, model=llama3.1:8b, metro-linux p2p
Same graph as r49, same flags as r47. r49 eval (without smart/bio flags) scored 85.3%.

**Score without smart+bio flags (r49):** 85.3% (192/225)
**Score with smart+bio flags (r49b):** 88.0% (198/225)
Key insight: --mode smart enables Replace mode for family_relation queries;
--biographical-expansion forces detailed LLM answers for "who was" questions.
Missing these flags caused Q09 to score 3/9 (one-liner) vs 9/9 (perfect with flags).

## r48 — 2026-06-17 21:18 — **80.0% (180.0/225)** ⚠️ regression

**Flags:** smart mode, biographical-expansion, model=llama3.1:8b, metro-linux p2p, num_ctx=8192

**Changes since r47:**
- **Code**: restored demanding prompt for "tell me about" / "describe" (is_bio_tell fix — only "tell me more about" uses simple prompt)
- **YAML**: Gandhi description — satyagraha front-loaded as primary term
- **YAML**: Indian Opinion — satyagraha/passive front-loaded
- **YAML**: NEUM — "boycott policy of non-collaboration" moved to first sentence
- **YAML**: TLSA — "boycott policy of non-collaboration" front-loaded
- **YAML**: NEF — added "debates" keyword
- **YAML**: Haji Joosub — moved Indian Opinion/Gandhi friendship sentence earlier
- Re-seeded (new relations) + re-embedded

**vs r47 (197.0/225 = 87.6%):** −17.0 pts — catastrophic regression

| Q | r47 | r48 | delta | Note |

| q09 | 8 | 3 | -5 | Correct entity injected but LLM gave one-liner: "was Haji Joosub Maulvi Hamid Gool [1]." — likely degraded p2p inference |

| q20 | 5 | 4 | -1 | Cricket question regression |
| q26 | 6 | 4 | -2 | Abdurahman regression |

| q32 | 5 | 3 | -2 | Cissie-Gool relationship regression |
| q33 | 5 | 3 | -2 | Notable figures regression |
| q37 | 6 | 4 | -2 | Wrong entity: [Graph: League of South Africa] instead of Gandhi/Indian Opinion |
| q38 | 4 | 2 | -2 | Wrong entity: [Graph: Peter Alexander Rassool] instead of Cissie Gool |

**Root cause of regression:**
- YAML description changes altered entity embeddings → broke routing for Q37 (→ "League of South Africa" garbage entity) and Q38 (→ Peter Rassool)
- "League of South Africa" is a spurious extracted entity with garbage description (foundingDate="...quoting from Homer") — its name overlaps "South Africa" in Q37 → scores 2.1
- P2p inference was degraded at eval time (2-7x slower than r47) → Q09 one-liner answer despite correct entity injection

**Fixes implemented for r49:**
- **EE prompt**: added `description` field to no_relations JSON schema (text-based, not mechanical)
- **EE prompt**: added candidate subset rule (skip "League of South Africa" when "Teachers League of South Africa" is also a candidate)
- **EE prompt**: tightened field value validation (must be verbatim date/name/place from text)
- **ingestion.rs**: flipped description priority — text-extracted description wins over description_from_fields()
- **YAML**: added 5 person-to-person associations (Gandhi↔Haji Joosub, Gandhi↔Abdurahman, Abdurahman↔Haji Joosub, Yousuf↔Hassen Mall, Kies↔Tabata)

## r47 — 2026-06-17 20:30 — **87.6% (197.0/225)** ⭐ new best

**Flags:** smart mode, biographical-expansion, model=llama3.1:8b, metro-linux p2p, num_ctx=8192

**Changes since r46:**
- **Code**: Split is_bio prompt — "tell me more about" uses simpler "comprehensive answer" prompt; "tell me about" / "describe" keep demanding multi-dimension prompt
- **YAML**: Added 3 new entities: Kloof Nek (Place), Hewat Training College (Org), Kismets Cricket Club (Org)
- **YAML**: Indian Opinion — added satyagraha/passive civil disobedience/non-violent; added Buitencingle Street reference
- **YAML**: J.M.H. Gool & Co — led with "Joosub"; added Cissie daughter-in-law/Abdurahman info
- **YAML**: Hassen Mall — added description with cricket/District Six keywords
- Re-seeded (74 entities) + re-embedded

| q08 | 2 | 5 | +3 | is_bio_tell_more simpler prompt — LLM no longer refuses for "tell me more about wife" |
| q20 | 2 | 5 | +3 | Kismets Cricket Club entity — "Western Province", "non-European", "District Six" all hit |
| q32 | 3 | 5 | +2 | J.M.H. Gool & Co. now has daughter-in-law/Abdurahman info — entity wins and has answer |
| q10 | 5 | 6 | +1 | New Kloof Nek entity — "saddle", "Lion's Head", "Table Mountain", etc. |
| q17 | 3 | 4 | +1 | New Hewat Training College entity — "Coloured students", "teacher training" |
| q35 | 3 | 4 | +1 | Hassen Mall description added with cricket/friend keywords |

| q18 | 5 | 4 | -1 | LLM non-det regression (debates/lectures not output) |

| q31 | 5 | 4 | -1 | LLM non-det regression |
| q34 | 6 | 5 | -1 | LLM non-det regression |

**Root cause of Q06 regression:** The is_bio_tell_more / is_bio_tell split unintentionally applied simpler prompt to "tell me about" (not just "tell me more about"). Fixed in r48: only "tell me more about" uses simple prompt; "tell me about" and "describe" restored to demanding multi-dimension prompt.

**Still broken:**
- q06 (4/8): "belt", "No. 7", "Table Mountain" missing — demanding prompt restored in r48
- q08 (5/6): Nazima answer still 1 point short of perfect
- q09 (8/9): "Swat" LLM substitutes "Pathan region near Afghanistan" — hard to fix
- q16 (5/7): "satyagraha" and "passive" not output — entity descriptions updated in r48
- q27 (4/5): "Indian Opinion" not output — grandfather entity updated in r48
- q29 (4/6): "boycott" and "non-collaboration" not output — NEUM/TLSA entities updated in r48
- q30 (3/6): "Swat", "Gujarat", "Joosub" not in LLM answer — structural issue
- q37 (6/7): "satyagraha" still not output — Gandhi entity updated in r48

**Next:** r48 targets: Q06+2, Q11+1, Q16+2, Q18+1, Q27+1, Q29+2, Q37+1 → target ~207/225 (92%)

- **Bug fix**: `reembed_all` now skips description_from_fields for YAML-seeded entities (extraction_confidence=1.0) — was destroying Nazima, Cissie, Yousuf, Haji Joosub descriptions on every reembed
- **Bug fix**: name_overlap abbreviation token weighting — dot-containing tokens like "j.m.h" count double, fixes Q30 entity injection (was injecting "Cape Town-Woodstock P.T.A" instead of Haji Joosub)
- YAML: Added siblings to Yousuf Rassool description (Abdul/Doolie, Fazil, Zain, Rasheda, Berina, Yasmin/Jessie, Nasim)
- YAML: Added "Indian Opinion (March 1914)" to Haji Joosub description

- q30 (3/6): Partial fix — gets some keywords (3/5) but not all
- q27 (4/5): Indian Opinion didn't fire — likely entity embedding needed more time
