## r48 — 2026-06-17 21:18 — **80.0% (180.0/225)** ⚠️ regression

**Flags:** smart mode, biographical-expansion, model=llama3.1:8b, metro-linux p2p, num_ctx=8192

**Changes since r47:**
- **Code**: restored demanding prompt for "tell me about" / "describe" (is_bio_tell fix — only "tell me more about" uses simple prompt)
- **YAML**: Gandhi description — satyagraha front-loaded as primary term
- **YAML**: Indian Opinion — satyagraha/passive front-loaded
- **YAML**: NEUM — "boycott policy of non-collaboration" moved to first sentence
- **YAML**: TLSA — "boycott policy of non-collaboration" front-loaded
- **YAML**: NEF — added "debates" keyword
- **YAML**: Haji Joosub — moved Indian Opinion/Gandhi friendship sentence earlier
- Re-seeded (new relations) + re-embedded

**vs r47 (197.0/225 = 87.6%):** −17.0 pts — catastrophic regression

| Q | r47 | r48 | delta | Note |
|---|-----|-----|-------|------|
| q06 | 4 | 5 | +1 | demanding prompt restored — "belt", "No. 7", "Table Mountain" returned |
| q11 | 5 | 6 | +1 | TLSA entity enriched |
| q18 | 4 | 6 | +2 | NEF "debates" keyword fix worked |
| q09 | 8 | 3 | -5 | Correct entity injected but LLM gave one-liner: "was Haji Joosub Maulvi Hamid Gool [1]." — likely degraded p2p inference |
| q16 | 5 | 4 | -1 | Gandhi/satyagraha regression |
| q20 | 5 | 4 | -1 | Cricket question regression |
| q26 | 6 | 4 | -2 | Abdurahman regression |
| q27 | 5 | 4 | -1 | Indian Opinion still missing |
| q30 | 4 | 4 | 0 | No change (J.M.H. Gool & Co. entity) |
| q31 | 5 | 4 | -1 | Mosque question regression |
| q32 | 5 | 3 | -2 | Cissie-Gool relationship regression |
| q33 | 5 | 3 | -2 | Notable figures regression |
| q37 | 6 | 4 | -2 | Wrong entity: [Graph: League of South Africa] instead of Gandhi/Indian Opinion |
| q38 | 4 | 2 | -2 | Wrong entity: [Graph: Peter Alexander Rassool] instead of Cissie Gool |

**Root cause of regression:**
- YAML description changes altered entity embeddings → broke routing for Q37 (→ "League of South Africa" garbage entity) and Q38 (→ Peter Rassool)
- "League of South Africa" is a spurious extracted entity with garbage description (foundingDate="...quoting from Homer") — its name overlaps "South Africa" in Q37 → scores 2.1
- P2p inference was degraded at eval time (2-7x slower than r47) → Q09 one-liner answer despite correct entity injection

**Fixes implemented for r49:**
- **EE prompt**: added `description` field to no_relations JSON schema (text-based, not mechanical)
- **EE prompt**: added candidate subset rule (skip "League of South Africa" when "Teachers League of South Africa" is also a candidate)
- **EE prompt**: tightened field value validation (must be verbatim date/name/place from text)
- **ingestion.rs**: flipped description priority — text-extracted description wins over description_from_fields()
- **YAML**: added 5 person-to-person associations (Gandhi↔Haji Joosub, Gandhi↔Abdurahman, Abdurahman↔Haji Joosub, Yousuf↔Hassen Mall, Kies↔Tabata)

## r47 — 2026-06-17 20:30 — **87.6% (197.0/225)** ⭐ new best

**Flags:** smart mode, biographical-expansion, model=llama3.1:8b, metro-linux p2p, num_ctx=8192

**Changes since r46:**
- **Code**: Split is_bio prompt — "tell me more about" uses simpler "comprehensive answer" prompt; "tell me about" / "describe" keep demanding multi-dimension prompt
- **YAML**: Added 3 new entities: Kloof Nek (Place), Hewat Training College (Org), Kismets Cricket Club (Org)
- **YAML**: Indian Opinion — added satyagraha/passive civil disobedience/non-violent; added Buitencingle Street reference
- **YAML**: J.M.H. Gool & Co — led with "Joosub"; added Cissie daughter-in-law/Abdurahman info
- **YAML**: Hassen Mall — added description with cricket/District Six keywords
- Re-seeded (74 entities) + re-embedded

**vs r46 (191.0/225 = 84.9%):** +6.0 pts

| Q | r46 | r47 | delta | Note |
|---|-----|-----|-------|------|
| q08 | 2 | 5 | +3 | is_bio_tell_more simpler prompt — LLM no longer refuses for "tell me more about wife" |
| q20 | 2 | 5 | +3 | Kismets Cricket Club entity — "Western Province", "non-European", "District Six" all hit |
| q32 | 3 | 5 | +2 | J.M.H. Gool & Co. now has daughter-in-law/Abdurahman info — entity wins and has answer |
| q10 | 5 | 6 | +1 | New Kloof Nek entity — "saddle", "Lion's Head", "Table Mountain", etc. |
| q17 | 3 | 4 | +1 | New Hewat Training College entity — "Coloured students", "teacher training" |
| q35 | 3 | 4 | +1 | Hassen Mall description added with cricket/friend keywords |
| q37 | 5 | 6 | +1 | Indian Opinion now has passive/satyagraha — entity hit for Gandhi question |
| q39 | 5 | 6 | +1 | Improvement |
| q40 | 4 | 5 | +1 | Improvement |
| q06 | 6 | 4 | -2 | REGRESSION: is_bio_tell_more simpler prompt also applied to "tell me about" — killed Q06 structured answer |
| q05 | 7 | 6 | -1 | LLM non-det regression |
| q11 | 6 | 5 | -1 | LLM non-det regression (boycott keyword not output) |
| q18 | 5 | 4 | -1 | LLM non-det regression (debates/lectures not output) |
| q19 | 6 | 5 | -1 | LLM non-det regression |
| q31 | 5 | 4 | -1 | LLM non-det regression |
| q34 | 6 | 5 | -1 | LLM non-det regression |

**Root cause of Q06 regression:** The is_bio_tell_more / is_bio_tell split unintentionally applied simpler prompt to "tell me about" (not just "tell me more about"). Fixed in r48: only "tell me more about" uses simple prompt; "tell me about" and "describe" restored to demanding multi-dimension prompt.

**Still broken:**
- q06 (4/8): "belt", "No. 7", "Table Mountain" missing — demanding prompt restored in r48
- q08 (5/6): Nazima answer still 1 point short of perfect
- q09 (8/9): "Swat" LLM substitutes "Pathan region near Afghanistan" — hard to fix
- q16 (5/7): "satyagraha" and "passive" not output — entity descriptions updated in r48
- q27 (4/5): "Indian Opinion" not output — grandfather entity updated in r48
- q29 (4/6): "boycott" and "non-collaboration" not output — NEUM/TLSA entities updated in r48
- q30 (3/6): "Swat", "Gujarat", "Joosub" not in LLM answer — structural issue
- q37 (6/7): "satyagraha" still not output — Gandhi entity updated in r48

**Next:** r48 targets: Q06+2, Q11+1, Q16+2, Q18+1, Q27+1, Q29+2, Q37+1 → target ~207/225 (92%)

**Flags:** smart mode, biographical-expansion, model=llama3.1:8b, metro-linux p2p, num_ctx=8192

**Changes since r45:**
- **Bug fix**: `reembed_all` now skips description_from_fields for YAML-seeded entities (extraction_confidence=1.0) — was destroying Nazima, Cissie, Yousuf, Haji Joosub descriptions on every reembed
- **Bug fix**: name_overlap abbreviation token weighting — dot-containing tokens like "j.m.h" count double, fixes Q30 entity injection (was injecting "Cape Town-Woodstock P.T.A" instead of Haji Joosub)
- YAML: Added siblings to Yousuf Rassool description (Abdul/Doolie, Fazil, Zain, Rasheda, Berina, Yasmin/Jessie, Nasim)
- YAML: Added "Indian Opinion (March 1914)" to Haji Joosub description
- Re-seeded + re-embedded with fixed code

**vs r45 (175.0/225 = 77.8%):** +16.0 pts

| Q | r45 | r46 | delta | Note |
|---|-----|-----|-------|------|
| q23 | 1 | 5 | +4 | Siblings added to Yousuf entity — Abdul, Fazil, Zain, Rasheda all hit |
| q06 | 3 | 6 | +3 | Buitencingle entity description now preserved after reembed (seeded) |
| q13 | 3 | 6 | +3 | All Africa Convention — bonus from reembed fix preserving seeded entities |
| q12 | 4 | 6 | +2 | Cissie Gool description preserved → properly injected for Q12 |
| q26 | 4 | 6 | +2 | Abdurahman description preserved → better injection |
| q30 | 1 | 3 | +2 | Abbreviation token fix → Haji Joosub injected (partial, Mauritius/India/Swat) |
| q39 | 3 | 5 | +2 | Improvement |

| q32 | 4 | 3 | -1 | Minor non-det regression |
| q35 | 4 | 3 | -1 | Minor non-det regression |

**Still broken:**
- q08 (2/6): Nazima entity still giving weak answer — possible description not fully reaching LLM in Replace mode
- q30 (3/6): Partial fix — gets some keywords (3/5) but not all
- q27 (4/5): Indian Opinion didn't fire — likely entity embedding needed more time

**Next:** Investigate Q08 Nazima path, stabilize Q20/Q29/Q37 non-det regressions
