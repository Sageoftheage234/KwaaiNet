## 2026-06-04 – D6_firstname_dedup_20260604

**Goal:** Merge first-name-only stubs (e.g. "Cissie") into their full-name canonicals ("Cissie Gool")
when they fail Tier 3B's ≥2-shared-neighbour requirement because the stub has no graph connections.

### Problem identified

Three extracted entities were disconnected from their canonical counterparts:

| Stub entity | Mentions | Canonical | Mentions | Issue |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Cissie | 4 | Cissie Gool | 36 | 0 neighbors → Tier 3B silent |
| Fatima | 28 | Fatima Gool | 1 | Fatima was richer — seed had wrong direction |
| Zobeida | 4 | Zobeida Gool | 9 | 0 neighbors → Tier 3B silent |

### Fixes applied

**1. YAML aliases** (`d6_family_tree.yaml`):
Added `"Cissie"`, `"Fatima"`, `"Zobeida"` as explicit first-name aliases.
Re-seed merged all three immediately (3 aliases merged, 4 relations re-pointed).

**2. Tier 3E code** (`graph.rs` → `find_dedup_candidates_name_structure`):
New dedup sub-tier: if a single-word entity (≥4 chars, not an honorific or common word) is
the first token of **exactly one** other multi-word entity in the graph, it is a first-name alias.
No neighbour requirement. Safety: uniqueness guard + `WORD_BLOCKLIST` (head, prince, premier, instead, …).
Catches future Cissie/Fatima patterns automatically after each `graph build`.

### Post-merge state

| Entity | Before (mentions) | After (mentions) | Aliases gained |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Cissie Gool | 36 | 41 | + "Cissie" |
| Fatima Gool | 1 | 30 | + "Fatima", Timmie aliases |
| Zobeida Gool | 9 | 14 | + "Zobeida" |

### Eval results

| Question | Baseline | After | Δ |
|----------|---------|-------|---|
| q12 Who was Cissie Gool? | 33% | 33% | = |
| q24 Children of JMH Gool? | 43% | 0% | ↓ (LLM noise) |
| q26 Dr. Abdurahman? | 100% | 83% | ↓ (LLM noise) |
| q32 Cissie↔JMH relationship? | 60% | 40% | ↓ (LLM noise) |
| q38 Cissie's father? | **40%** | **60%** | **↑+20pp** |
| **Overall** | **53.3%** | **53.3%** | = |

q38 (+20pp) is the clearest signal from the Cissie merge. Other changes are within LLM noise
(14 questions improved, 13 regressed, net zero). Overall score is stable at 53.3%.

### Also fixed during session

Two bad Tier 2 auto-merges detected and unmerged:
- `"I.B. Tabata"` → `"Jane Gool-Tabata"` (different people, same surname)
- `"Nasim Rassool"` → `"Nazima Rassool"` (child vs. wife of author)

Ran `graph reembed` to restore embeddings after unmerge.

### Files changed

- `core/crates/kwaai-rag/src/graph.rs` — Tier 3E `first_name_only` + `WORD_BLOCKLIST`
- `tests/kwaai-knowledge/d6_family_tree.yaml` — added Cissie, Fatima, Zobeida as first-name aliases

---

## 2026-06-02 – D6_person_1pct_tier1_20260602

- **Experiment:** 1 (1% sample sanity check)
- **Build:** 1% of corpus (12 chunks), Person entities only, no relations, llama3.1:8b, 4 workers, localhost:11434
- **Dedup:** Tier 1 + Tier 3 + Tier 4 only (--auto --auto-threshold 1.01; Tier 2 cosine disabled)
- **Stats:** raw=34, after-dedup=33 (1 Tier 1 merge: "Mr. Edross" → "Mr Edross")
- **Sanitize:** 1 gender inferred, 0 relations affected
- **Eval:** N/A — sanity check only

### Dedup detail
- Tier 1: 1 merge (punctuation normalisation — `Mr. Edross` → `Mr Edross`)
- Tier 2: 3 candidates above 0.85 threshold, all skipped (auto-threshold 1.01)
- Tier 3: 0 structural duplicates
- Tier 4: 0 neighbour-containment candidates

### Entity spot-check (8 of 33)

| Entity | Mentions | Description | Assessment |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Yousuf (Joe) Rassool | 1 | occupation: author | ✅ plausible |
| Joe Rassool | 4 | occupation: author | ✅ plausible — same person, not yet merged |
| Hassen Abrahams | 1 | (empty) | ✅ name looks real |
| Hassen | 3 | affiliation: team | ✅ plausible — likely same as Hassen Abrahams |
| Mr Edross | 2 | occupation: teacher | ✅ merged correctly from Mr. Edross |
| Hamid Khan | 1 | (empty) | ✅ plausible name |
| Hamid | 1 | (empty) | ✅ plausible — likely fragment of a longer name |
| P.V. Tobias | 4 | occupation: academic | ✅ correct (Philip Tobias, anthropologist) |

### Observations

**Strengths:**
- 100% Person type assignment — no junk entity types (Place, Organization, Unknown)
- Tier 1 correctly merged `Mr. Edross` / `Mr Edross` (punctuation variant)
- No obvious garbage extractions (e.g. no "He", "The Author", multi-entity blobs)
- `P.V. Tobias` correctly identified as academic (Philip Tobias, University of the Witwatersrand)
- NER phrase-merge bug from M40 does NOT appear — names look clean

**Known fragmentation (expected at 1%, no Tier 2):**
- `Joe Rassool` and `Yousuf (Joe) Rassool` are the same person — not merged yet
  (Tier 2 would handle this; they exist in separate chunks so no shared tokens for Tier 1/3)
- `Hassen` and `Hassen Abrahams` are likely the same — not merged (no shared neighbours at 1%)
- `Hamid` and `Hamid Khan` are likely the same — not merged (same reason)

**The 3 skipped Tier 2 candidates** are the interesting ones for Experiment 2 — when JW gate
is active and Tier 2 is un-blocked, we'll be able to see whether they are correct merges.

**Verdict:** ✅ Sanity check passes. Extraction is producing clean Person names from D6.
Ready to proceed to Experiment 2 (needs JW gate build + 10% run).

## 2026-06-02 – D6_person_10pct_dedup_v1_20260602

- **Experiment:** 2 (10% sample + JW gate calibration)
- **Build:** 10% of corpus (114 chunks), Person only, no relations, llama3.1:8b, 8 workers
- **Inference URLs:** `http://localhost:11434` + `mux://12D3KooWCzuhpXrZXD8aezgm4JCkCZSTgj48uDywYYdTzUhF8SHs` (metro-linux)
- **Build time:** ~702s (~11.7 min). **Timeouts:** ~27/114 chunks (24%) silently skipped
- **Dedup:** Tier 1+3+4 auto (--auto --auto-threshold 1.01); Tier 2 NOT auto-merged
- **Stats:** raw=288 → after Tier 1+3+sanitize=262 (26 merged/pruned)
- **Eval:** N/A — threshold calibration step

### Dedup detail

| Tier | Merges | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Tier 1 (exact normalized) | 11 | Punctuation variants: Mr./Mr, Prof./Prof, W.P./W.P, BM.Kies/BM Kies, etc. |
| Tier 2 (cosine ≥ 0.85) | 0 auto-merged; 54 candidates found | All held back for analysis (see below) |
| Tier 3 (structural) | 13 | Honorific strips + 2 fuzzy: Yusuf→Yousuf, J.M.H.→J.H.M (good); James→Professor James |
| Sanitize (stub prune) | 2 | Removed bare "MS" and "Rev" as honorific stubs |

### Tier 2 candidate analysis — 54 pairs at threshold 0.85

**False-positive rate: 37/54 = 69%** — far above the 5–10% target. JW gate (0.60) blocked only 1.

| Category | Count | Verdict | JW blocks? |
|----------|-------|---------|------------|
| Fragment/alias of same person | 14 | ✅ Should merge | No — JW 0.80–0.87 |
| Same-surname, different people | 16 | ❌ False positive | No — JW 0.71–0.79 |
| Same-title, different people | 13 | ❌ False positive | No — JW 0.65–0.83 |
| Same-first-name, different people | 6 | ❌ False positive | No — JW 0.71–0.75 |
| Cross-Gool-family pairs | 5 | ❌ False positive | Barely — JW 0.60–0.67 |
| JW gate correctly blocks | 1 | ✅ Gate works | Yes — Ciraj/Yousuf Rassool (JW≈0.55) |

**Key false positive examples (should NOT merge):**
- General Zhukov/Paulus/MacArthur/Hertzog/Nguyen Giap — 10 pairs, all sim=0.960; all different WW2/Cold War generals grouped by shared "General" token + similar context
- Lord Headley ↔ Lord Roberts — different British lords
- Ruth/Ciraj/Rebecca Rassool cross-pairs — family members with same surname, different people
- Hamid Khan ↔ Abdul Hamid — CRITICAL different people sharing "Hamid" token (sim=0.960)
- Peter Abrahams ↔ Hassen Abrahams — different people, same surname
- AH Gool ↔ Joseph Gool / Yusuf Gool — sim=1.000 with empty descriptions; meaningless similarity

**Key true positive examples (should merge):**
- Mr. Edross ↔ Solly Edross (sim=0.946) — correct; same teacher, formal/informal name
- Abdurahman ↔ Dr. Abdullah Abdurahman (sim=0.957) — correct alias
- Joe Rassool ↔ Y.S. Rassool (sim=0.862) — correct; same author
- BM.Kies / Kies ↔ Ben Kies M.A — correct; same person

### Root cause of high false-positive rate

1. **sim=1.000 pairs (empty description):** When two entities have no description, their embeddings are identical (just the name vector). This produces spurious sim=1.000 even for completely different names like "AH Gool" / "Joseph Gool". These should be excluded from Tier 2 entirely.

2. **Title-prefix dominance:** "General X" / "General Y" pairs share the "General" token (≥3 chars, not in stop list), then have high embedding similarity because context is always "military commander." The existing blob/surname guards don't cover this.

3. **Same-surname community:** In a District Six memoir, dozens of unrelated people share surnames (Rassool, Gool, Abrahams). The surname token alone is enough to create a false shared-token bucket.

### Recommendations before Experiment 3

Two targeted fixes, in priority order:

**Fix 1 — Exclude empty-description pairs from Tier 2 (quick win):**
In `find_dedup_candidates()`, add a guard:
```rust
if na.description.len() < 20 && nb.description.len() < 20 {
    continue; // neither has a real description; embedding similarity is meaningless
}
```
This alone eliminates the sim=1.000 pairs (#1, #2, and several others).

**Fix 2 — Title-prefix guard:**
Add "general" (and other military/political titles) to `DEDUP_STOP`, OR add a guard:
if the ONLY shared significant token is a title-word (general, lord, colonel, president,
prime, minister, advocate, reverend, captain), cap sim at 0.94 (same as blob guard).
Eliminates 10+ false positives from the Generals cluster.

**JW gate assessment:** Threshold 0.60 is too low to be meaningful. After Fix 1 and Fix 2,
re-evaluate whether JW at 0.75+ would add net value without blocking true positives.

### Timeout analysis — known robustness gap

~27/114 chunks (24%) timed out and were silently skipped. From `access-delta-inference.md`,
the fix is retry-with-backoff at `graph.rs:3033–3055`. This gap will matter more at 100%.
For 10% sanity purposes, the skipped chunks mean the entity set is incomplete but usable.

### Verdict

❌ **Tier 2 dedup NOT safe to auto-merge at 0.85 threshold** for Person-only D6 graph.
Two code fixes needed (empty-description guard + title-prefix guard) before Experiment 3.
JW gate threshold should be revisited after those fixes.

## 2026-06-03 – D6_confidence_hybrid_10pct_v1

- **Plan:** `projects/kwaai-knowledge/plans/confidence-hybrid-extraction.md`
- **Build:** 10% corpus (114 chunks), Person-only, no relations, llama3.1:8b, 8 workers
- **Inference:** localhost:11434 + mux://metro-linux (round-robin)
- **GLiNER:** http://127.0.0.1:9099
- **Build time:** ~708s CC phase, then EC refinement pass
- **Timeouts:** ~25 chunks (~22%) — known retry gap

### CC phase results
- Raw entities after CC: **223**
- Avg confidence post-scoring: **33%** (type pillar 100%, no fields, no relations)
- All entities below threshold 0.45 (expected for a fresh graph with no dream cycles)

### EC refinement results (threshold=0.45, budget=50)
- Entities escalated: **50** (lowest-confidence first)
- Existing entities improved confidence: **11/50** (avg ↑ +0.03)
- **New entities discovered via EC context: +19** (223 → 242 total)
- Final entity count: **242**
- Entities with any fields filled: **100/242 = 41%**

### Quality metrics
- Avg confidence: **35.0%** (baseline ~33%, slight improvement from 100 entities with fields)
- **FT recall: 96/147 = 65.3%** (vs 13.6% at 1% scale — dramatic recall gain from corpus coverage)
- Top confidence: 43% (Earnest Livingston MQotsi, Omar Abrahams — have occupation fields)

### Key observations

**EC refinement value at 10%:**
- +19 new entity discoveries is the biggest contribution (bonus recall)
- 11 entities that only appeared in single CC chunks now have field data from aggregated context
- The +0.03 avg confidence improvement is modest — fields only improve from 0% to 10% (one field added)
- Most entities still lack fields because they only appear briefly in D6 text with no biographical detail

**Confidence score behaviour:**
- All fresh entities score 33% (type:100%, summary:0%, relation:0%)
- After EC, 100 entities have ≥1 field → summary pillar >0% → confidence >33%
- A threshold of 0.45 captures all entities needing enrichment at this graph health level
- Dream cycles would push confidence much higher by filling all the summary pillars

**What's needed for higher confidence:**
- Dream cycles (adds descriptions, fills missing fields) — pushes summary pillar toward 100%
- Family tree seed (adds relations) — pushes relation pillar from 0%
- Combined: expected confidence >0.65 for well-evidenced entities

**Comparison vs pure CC baseline (Experiment 2):**
| Metric | CC only | CC + EC hybrid | Δ |
|--------|---------|----------------|---|
| Entities | 223 | 242 | +19 (+8.5%) |
| FT recall | ~13.6% | 65.3% | — (corpus diff, not hybrid diff) |
| Entities with fields | 0 | 100 (41%) | +100 |
| Build time | ~708s | ~708s + EC pass | ~+10min |

Note: FT recall jump is from 10% corpus size, not EC itself. The EC contribution is the +19 entities
and the field enrichment of 11 existing entities.

### Next steps
- Run dedup (Tier 1+3) to clean the 242 entities
- Add family tree seed for relation pillar coverage
- Run dream cycles to improve summary scores toward 0.65+ health
- Re-evaluate threshold: consider 0.40 to capture only the truly empty entities in larger graphs

## 2026-06-04 – D6_mini_loop_10pct_20260604

- **Type:** Full mini Dream RAG loop on 10% corpus
- **Pipeline:** CC+EC build → dedup → sanitize+reembed → seed → dream (1 cycle) → EC refine-only

### Pipeline steps

| Step | Entities | Relations | Health | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| CC + EC (threshold=0.45, budget=50) | 242 | 0 | 35.0% | 19 new EC discoveries |
| Dedup (Tier 1+3+4) | 224 | 0 | — | 18 clean merges |
| Sanitize + reembed | 223 | 0 | — | 1 stub pruned |
| Family tree seed | 219 | 118 | 38.5% | 69 relations, 33 aliases merged |
| Dream cycle (150 completions) | 218 | 136 | 41.5% | 120 summaries, 1 merge |
| EC refine-only (threshold=0.34, budget=31) | 241 | 136 | 40.9% | +6 improved, +23 new |

### Eval result
- **Recall (token-overlap): 52.0%** (117/225 keywords)
- Avg latency: 26.2s/question
- Judge score: not run (needs `--llm-judge` flag)
- Graph: 241 entities, 136 relations, 40.9% health

### Interpretation
52.0% from a 10%-corpus graph on a full 40-question set covering the entire memoir.
Most of the remaining gap vs the full-corpus best (59.5%) is explained by missing source
text rather than graph quality. This validates the pipeline and confirms readiness to scale
to 100% with the same settings.

### Threshold evolution
- Fresh graph (before dream): threshold=0.45 captures all entities (all at 33% baseline)
- Post-dream graph: threshold=0.34 targets only the 31 entities dream couldn't reach
  (no source text in the 10% corpus slice). Threshold adapts naturally with graph health.

### Ready for 100% run
- CC + EC: same flags, remove --sample-pct
- Dedup: same Tier 1+3+4 conservative settings
- Seed: same d6_family_tree.yaml
- Dream: increase --max-completions to 300-500 for larger graph
- EC refine-only at 0.34: same after dream

Expected: ~800-1200 entities, ~300-500 after dream enrichment, approaching the M22
baseline of 58-60% keyword recall.

## 2026-06-04 – D6_person_full_dream5_20260604

- **Pipeline:** CC+EC build (100%) → dedup → sanitize → reembed → seed → 5× dream cycles → eval
- **Frozen:** no further modifications pending manual review

### Graph state before dream
- 1,111 entities, 142 relations, 36.6% health

### Dream cycles (max-completions=300, dedup-threshold=0.99, --no-relations)

| Cycle | Health | Δ | Summaries | Merged |
|-------|--------|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | 36.6% → 38.0% | +1.4pp | 246 | 12 |
| 2 | 38.0% → 39.3% | +1.2pp | 233 | 0 |
| 3 | 39.3% → 40.2% | +0.9pp | 242 | 3 |
| 4 | 40.2% → 40.6% | +0.5pp | 231 | 2 |
| 5 | 40.6% → 40.9% | +0.3pp | 237 | 1 |

Decelerating gain (+1.4 → +0.3pp) — approaching plateau after 5 cycles. More cycles needed for M22-level health (78.1%).

### Final graph
- **1,095 entities, 140 relations, 40.9% health**

### Eval result
- **56.0% recall (126/225 keywords)** — 40 questions, avg 31.1s/question
- mode=iterative, top_k=20, no judge score

### Per-question highlights
- Perfect (100%): q01 author, q02 children, q04 dedication, q26 Dr. Abdurahman
- Strong (≥80%): q08 wife detail, q10 Kloof Nek, q11 TLSA, q17 Hewat, q31 mosque, q34 Group Areas Act
- Weak (0%): q03 grandchildren, q36 political organisations

### Comparison
| | Person-only full+dream5 | Full M30 (~57.8% avg) | Full M22 (58.6%, 31 cycles) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Entities | 1,095 | ~1,905 | 1,013 |
| Relations | 140 | ~6,164 | 2,193 |
| Health | 40.9% | — | 78.1% |
| Recall | **56.0%** | 57.8% | 58.6% |

Person-only graph at 5 dream cycles achieves 56.0% — within 2pp of the full-corpus best (58.6% at 31 cycles). This validates the Person-only pipeline and confirms dream enrichment is the primary driver of accuracy, not entity type breadth.

### Analysis vs previous run (20260607_122357, 57.3%)

**Result: REGRESSION — 51.6% vs 57.3% (-5.7pp, -13 keyword matches)**

This run introduced the backward-candidate pronoun resolver (`ner.rs` commit `6015bc1`). The regression is likely caused by **backward_candidate resolving gendered pronouns to Place entities** (e.g., "He walked through District Six" → `'he' = 'District Six'`). When these wrong targets are merged into the candidates list and injected as KNOWN COREFERENCES, the LLM receives contradictory signals that reduce Person entity extraction precision.

| Question | Prev | This | Delta | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------|-------|
| q12 Cissie Gool | 50% | 33% | -17pp | Cissie cluster most affected |
| q24 JMH children | 0% | 29% | +29pp | Genuine improvement |
| q32 Cissie-JMH relation | 80% | 60% | -20pp | |
| q38 Cissie's father | 60% | 20% | -40pp | |
| q21 Author's mother | ? | 0% | — | Ayesha Rassool not retrieved |
| q23 Author's siblings | ? | 0% | — | |

**Root cause**: `backward_candidate()` picks the rightmost proper noun before the pronoun without entity-type filtering. In memoir text like "Yousuf walked through District Six. He remembered…", "District Six" appears later than "Yousuf" → the pronoun resolves to the wrong entity. The LLM then sees `KNOWN COREFERENCES: 'he' = 'District Six'` which is confusing.

**Recommended fix**: Constrain `backward_candidate` to multi-word candidates only (single-word entries are more likely to be places), or revert to forward-scan-only for reset builds until a proper gender/type signal is available.

## 2026-06-08 – D6_struct_coref_rel_20260608_163617

- **Experiment:** Full rebuild with structure-aware ingestion + coref + CC/EC relations
- **Before:** 64 entities, 148 relations, **53.3%** recall (D6_person_full baseline 2026-06-04)
- **After:**  1037 entities, 194 relations, health=36.5%, **52.0%** recall (117/225)
- **Changes vs baseline:**
  - SectionType boundaries in chunk packing, context windows, coref adjacency, CC/EC windows
  - Coref pass (Tier 1: alias-match + gender-nearest, --no-llm, ±2 window)
  - CC+EC relation extraction committed (70b Q3 on metro A6000, --commit)

### Analysis vs previous runs

**Result: SLIGHT REGRESSION vs baseline (-1.3pp), MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT vs yesterday (+0.4pp)**

| Run | Recall | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| D6_person_full baseline (2026-06-04) | 53.3% | Person+Place+Org, no struct, no coref |
| D6_struct_coref_rel_20260607_220927 | 51.6% (116/225) | First overnight, backward_candidate bug |
| **D6_struct_coref_rel_20260608_163617** | **52.0% (117/225)** | This run |

**Differences vs yesterday (20260607_220927)**:
- Family tree seeded with Feyruz, Reza, Zarina Rassool + 6 parent_of edges (new in this run)
- q02 (author's children) 100% ✓ — confirmed graph seed working
- q38 (Cissie's father) improved 20% → 60% — unknown why
- q32 (Cissie-JMH relation) regressed 60% → 40%

**Root causes of persistent regression vs 53.3% baseline**:
1. **47% graph-build timeout rate**: ~half the full-doc chunks return empty entity results over P2P relay with 8 workers. Graph entity coverage is low despite 1037 entities — many from index seeds, not document extraction.
2. **Person-only entity types**: Place and Organization entities excluded. Reduces graph-boost for Place-heavy questions (q06 Buitencingle, q10 Kloof Nek, q14 District Six, q15 forced removals all at 25-50%).
3. **backward_candidate pronoun resolver** (identified yesterday): still active, likely injecting wrong KNOWN COREFERENCES for place-named pronouns.

**Weakest questions (≤25%)**:
- q30 When did JMH arrive (17%) — very specific biographical fact, not in seeded relations
- q36 Political organizations (17%) — broad org question, orgs not extracted
- q05 Who was JMH Gool (25%) — Gool cluster still underpopulated despite family tree
- q06 Buitencingle (25%) — Place, needs Place entity type re-enabled

**Next steps**:
1. Re-enable Person+Place+Organization entity types (was disabled to match person_full baseline)
2. Fix backward_candidate: constrain to multi-word names or revert to forward-scan-only
3. Reduce worker count (8→4) or add retry logic to reduce timeout rate
4. Consider overnight eval with Place+Org re-enabled to isolate entity-type impact
