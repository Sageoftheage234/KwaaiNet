## 2026-06-04 – D6_firstname_dedup_20260604

**Goal:** Merge first-name-only stubs (e.g. "Cissie") into their full-name canonicals ("Cissie Gool")
when they fail Tier 3B's ≥2-shared-neighbour requirement because the stub has no graph connections.

### Problem identified

Three extracted entities were disconnected from their canonical counterparts:

| Stub entity | Mentions | Canonical | Mentions | Issue |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Cissie | 4 | Cissie Gool | 36 | 0 neighbors → Tier 3B silent |
| Fatima | 28 | Fatima Gool | 1 | Fatima was richer — seed had wrong direction |
| Zobeida | 4 | Zobeida Gool | 9 | 0 neighbors → Tier 3B silent |

### Fixes applied

**1. YAML aliases** (`d6_family_tree.yaml`):
Added `"Cissie"`, `"Fatima"`, `"Zobeida"` as explicit first-name aliases.
Re-seed merged all three immediately (3 aliases merged, 4 relations re-pointed).

**2. Tier 3E code** (`graph.rs` → `find_dedup_candidates_name_structure`):
New dedup sub-tier: if a single-word entity (≥4 chars, not an honorific or common word) is
the first token of **exactly one** other multi-word entity in the graph, it is a first-name alias.
No neighbour requirement. Safety: uniqueness guard + `WORD_BLOCKLIST` (head, prince, premier, instead, …).
Catches future Cissie/Fatima patterns automatically after each `graph build`.

### Post-merge state

| Entity | Before (mentions) | After (mentions) | Aliases gained |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Cissie Gool | 36 | 41 | + "Cissie" |
| Fatima Gool | 1 | 30 | + "Fatima", Timmie aliases |
| Zobeida Gool | 9 | 14 | + "Zobeida" |

### Eval results

| Question | Baseline | After | Δ |
|----------|---------|-------|---|
| q12 Who was Cissie Gool? | 33% | 33% | = |
| q24 Children of JMH Gool? | 43% | 0% | ↓ (LLM noise) |
| q26 Dr. Abdurahman? | 100% | 83% | ↓ (LLM noise) |
| q32 Cissie↔JMH relationship? | 60% | 40% | ↓ (LLM noise) |
| q38 Cissie's father? | **40%** | **60%** | **↑+20pp** |
| **Overall** | **53.3%** | **53.3%** | = |

q38 (+20pp) is the clearest signal from the Cissie merge. Other changes are within LLM noise
(14 questions improved, 13 regressed, net zero). Overall score is stable at 53.3%.

### Also fixed during session

Two bad Tier 2 auto-merges detected and unmerged:
- `"I.B. Tabata"` → `"Jane Gool-Tabata"` (different people, same surname)
- `"Nasim Rassool"` → `"Nazima Rassool"` (child vs. wife of author)

Ran `graph reembed` to restore embeddings after unmerge.

### Files changed

- `core/crates/kwaai-rag/src/graph.rs` — Tier 3E `first_name_only` + `WORD_BLOCKLIST`
- `tests/kwaai-knowledge/d6_family_tree.yaml` — added Cissie, Fatima, Zobeida as first-name aliases

---

## 2026-06-02 – D6_person_1pct_tier1_20260602

- **Experiment:** 1 (1% sample sanity check)
- **Build:** 1% of corpus (12 chunks), Person entities only, no relations, llama3.1:8b, 4 workers, localhost:11434
- **Dedup:** Tier 1 + Tier 3 + Tier 4 only (--auto --auto-threshold 1.01; Tier 2 cosine disabled)
- **Stats:** raw=34, after-dedup=33 (1 Tier 1 merge: "Mr. Edross" → "Mr Edross")
- **Sanitize:** 1 gender inferred, 0 relations affected
- **Eval:** N/A — sanity check only

### Dedup detail
- Tier 1: 1 merge (punctuation normalisation — `Mr. Edross` → `Mr Edross`)
- Tier 2: 3 candidates above 0.85 threshold, all skipped (auto-threshold 1.01)
- Tier 3: 0 structural duplicates
- Tier 4: 0 neighbour-containment candidates

### Entity spot-check (8 of 33)

| Entity | Mentions | Description | Assessment |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Yousuf (Joe) Rassool | 1 | occupation: author | ✅ plausible |
| Joe Rassool | 4 | occupation: author | ✅ plausible — same person, not yet merged |
| Hassen Abrahams | 1 | (empty) | ✅ name looks real |
| Hassen | 3 | affiliation: team | ✅ plausible — likely same as Hassen Abrahams |
| Mr Edross | 2 | occupation: teacher | ✅ merged correctly from Mr. Edross |
| Hamid Khan | 1 | (empty) | ✅ plausible name |
| Hamid | 1 | (empty) | ✅ plausible — likely fragment of a longer name |
| P.V. Tobias | 4 | occupation: academic | ✅ correct (Philip Tobias, anthropologist) |

### Observations

**Strengths:**
- 100% Person type assignment — no junk entity types (Place, Organization, Unknown)
- Tier 1 correctly merged `Mr. Edross` / `Mr Edross` (punctuation variant)
- No obvious garbage extractions (e.g. no "He", "The Author", multi-entity blobs)
- `P.V. Tobias` correctly identified as academic (Philip Tobias, University of the Witwatersrand)
- NER phrase-merge bug from M40 does NOT appear — names look clean

**Known fragmentation (expected at 1%, no Tier 2):**
- `Joe Rassool` and `Yousuf (Joe) Rassool` are the same person — not merged yet
  (Tier 2 would handle this; they exist in separate chunks so no shared tokens for Tier 1/3)
- `Hassen` and `Hassen Abrahams` are likely the same — not merged (no shared neighbours at 1%)
- `Hamid` and `Hamid Khan` are likely the same — not merged (same reason)

**The 3 skipped Tier 2 candidates** are the interesting ones for Experiment 2 — when JW gate
is active and Tier 2 is un-blocked, we'll be able to see whether they are correct merges.

**Verdict:** ✅ Sanity check passes. Extraction is producing clean Person names from D6.
Ready to proceed to Experiment 2 (needs JW gate build + 10% run).

## 2026-06-02 – D6_person_10pct_dedup_v1_20260602

- **Experiment:** 2 (10% sample + JW gate calibration)
- **Build:** 10% of corpus (114 chunks), Person only, no relations, llama3.1:8b, 8 workers
- **Inference URLs:** `http://localhost:11434` + `mux://12D3KooWCzuhpXrZXD8aezgm4JCkCZSTgj48uDywYYdTzUhF8SHs` (metro-linux)
- **Build time:** ~702s (~11.7 min). **Timeouts:** ~27/114 chunks (24%) silently skipped
- **Dedup:** Tier 1+3+4 auto (--auto --auto-threshold 1.01); Tier 2 NOT auto-merged
- **Stats:** raw=288 → after Tier 1+3+sanitize=262 (26 merged/pruned)
- **Eval:** N/A — threshold calibration step

### Dedup detail

| Tier | Merges | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Tier 1 (exact normalized) | 11 | Punctuation variants: Mr./Mr, Prof./Prof, W.P./W.P, BM.Kies/BM Kies, etc. |
| Tier 2 (cosine ≥ 0.85) | 0 auto-merged; 54 candidates found | All held back for analysis (see below) |
| Tier 3 (structural) | 13 | Honorific strips + 2 fuzzy: Yusuf→Yousuf, J.M.H.→J.H.M (good); James→Professor James |
| Sanitize (stub prune) | 2 | Removed bare "MS" and "Rev" as honorific stubs |

### Tier 2 candidate analysis — 54 pairs at threshold 0.85

**False-positive rate: 37/54 = 69%** — far above the 5–10% target. JW gate (0.60) blocked only 1.

| Category | Count | Verdict | JW blocks? |
|----------|-------|---------|------------|
| Fragment/alias of same person | 14 | ✅ Should merge | No — JW 0.80–0.87 |
| Same-surname, different people | 16 | ❌ False positive | No — JW 0.71–0.79 |
| Same-title, different people | 13 | ❌ False positive | No — JW 0.65–0.83 |
| Same-first-name, different people | 6 | ❌ False positive | No — JW 0.71–0.75 |
| Cross-Gool-family pairs | 5 | ❌ False positive | Barely — JW 0.60–0.67 |
| JW gate correctly blocks | 1 | ✅ Gate works | Yes — Ciraj/Yousuf Rassool (JW≈0.55) |

**Key false positive examples (should NOT merge):**
- General Zhukov/Paulus/MacArthur/Hertzog/Nguyen Giap — 10 pairs, all sim=0.960; all different WW2/Cold War generals grouped by shared "General" token + similar context
- Lord Headley ↔ Lord Roberts — different British lords
- Ruth/Ciraj/Rebecca Rassool cross-pairs — family members with same surname, different people
- Hamid Khan ↔ Abdul Hamid — CRITICAL different people sharing "Hamid" token (sim=0.960)
- Peter Abrahams ↔ Hassen Abrahams — different people, same surname
- AH Gool ↔ Joseph Gool / Yusuf Gool — sim=1.000 with empty descriptions; meaningless similarity

**Key true positive examples (should merge):**
- Mr. Edross ↔ Solly Edross (sim=0.946) — correct; same teacher, formal/informal name
- Abdurahman ↔ Dr. Abdullah Abdurahman (sim=0.957) — correct alias
- Joe Rassool ↔ Y.S. Rassool (sim=0.862) — correct; same author
- BM.Kies / Kies ↔ Ben Kies M.A — correct; same person

### Root cause of high false-positive rate

1. **sim=1.000 pairs (empty description):** When two entities have no description, their embeddings are identical (just the name vector). This produces spurious sim=1.000 even for completely different names like "AH Gool" / "Joseph Gool". These should be excluded from Tier 2 entirely.

2. **Title-prefix dominance:** "General X" / "General Y" pairs share the "General" token (≥3 chars, not in stop list), then have high embedding similarity because context is always "military commander." The existing blob/surname guards don't cover this.

3. **Same-surname community:** In a District Six memoir, dozens of unrelated people share surnames (Rassool, Gool, Abrahams). The surname token alone is enough to create a false shared-token bucket.

### Recommendations before Experiment 3

Two targeted fixes, in priority order:

**Fix 1 — Exclude empty-description pairs from Tier 2 (quick win):**
In `find_dedup_candidates()`, add a guard:
```rust
if na.description.len() < 20 && nb.description.len() < 20 {
    continue; // neither has a real description; embedding similarity is meaningless
}
```
This alone eliminates the sim=1.000 pairs (#1, #2, and several others).

**Fix 2 — Title-prefix guard:**
Add "general" (and other military/political titles) to `DEDUP_STOP`, OR add a guard:
if the ONLY shared significant token is a title-word (general, lord, colonel, president,
prime, minister, advocate, reverend, captain), cap sim at 0.94 (same as blob guard).
Eliminates 10+ false positives from the Generals cluster.

**JW gate assessment:** Threshold 0.60 is too low to be meaningful. After Fix 1 and Fix 2,
re-evaluate whether JW at 0.75+ would add net value without blocking true positives.

### Timeout analysis — known robustness gap

~27/114 chunks (24%) timed out and were silently skipped. From `access-delta-inference.md`,
the fix is retry-with-backoff at `graph.rs:3033–3055`. This gap will matter more at 100%.
For 10% sanity purposes, the skipped chunks mean the entity set is incomplete but usable.

### Verdict

❌ **Tier 2 dedup NOT safe to auto-merge at 0.85 threshold** for Person-only D6 graph.
Two code fixes needed (empty-description guard + title-prefix guard) before Experiment 3.
JW gate threshold should be revisited after those fixes.

## 2026-06-03 – D6_confidence_hybrid_10pct_v1

- **Plan:** `projects/kwaai-knowledge/plans/confidence-hybrid-extraction.md`
- **Build:** 10% corpus (114 chunks), Person-only, no relations, llama3.1:8b, 8 workers
- **Inference:** localhost:11434 + mux://metro-linux (round-robin)
- **GLiNER:** http://127.0.0.1:9099
- **Build time:** ~708s CC phase, then EC refinement pass
- **Timeouts:** ~25 chunks (~22%) — known retry gap

### CC phase results
- Raw entities after CC: **223**
- Avg confidence post-scoring: **33%** (type pillar 100%, no fields, no relations)
- All entities below threshold 0.45 (expected for a fresh graph with no dream cycles)

### EC refinement results (threshold=0.45, budget=50)
- Entities escalated: **50** (lowest-confidence first)
- Existing entities improved confidence: **11/50** (avg ↑ +0.03)
- **New entities discovered via EC context: +19** (223 → 242 total)
- Final entity count: **242**
- Entities with any fields filled: **100/242 = 41%**

### Quality metrics
- Avg confidence: **35.0%** (baseline ~33%, slight improvement from 100 entities with fields)
- **FT recall: 96/147 = 65.3%** (vs 13.6% at 1% scale — dramatic recall gain from corpus coverage)
- Top confidence: 43% (Earnest Livingston MQotsi, Omar Abrahams — have occupation fields)

### Key observations

**EC refinement value at 10%:**
- +19 new entity discoveries is the biggest contribution (bonus recall)
- 11 entities that only appeared in single CC chunks now have field data from aggregated context
- The +0.03 avg confidence improvement is modest — fields only improve from 0% to 10% (one field added)
- Most entities still lack fields because they only appear briefly in D6 text with no biographical detail

**Confidence score behaviour:**
- All fresh entities score 33% (type:100%, summary:0%, relation:0%)
- After EC, 100 entities have ≥1 field → summary pillar >0% → confidence >33%
- A threshold of 0.45 captures all entities needing enrichment at this graph health level
- Dream cycles would push confidence much higher by filling all the summary pillars

**What's needed for higher confidence:**
- Dream cycles (adds descriptions, fills missing fields) — pushes summary pillar toward 100%
- Family tree seed (adds relations) — pushes relation pillar from 0%
- Combined: expected confidence >0.65 for well-evidenced entities

**Comparison vs pure CC baseline (Experiment 2):**
| Metric | CC only | CC + EC hybrid | Δ |
|--------|---------|----------------|---|
| Entities | 223 | 242 | +19 (+8.5%) |
| FT recall | ~13.6% | 65.3% | — (corpus diff, not hybrid diff) |
| Entities with fields | 0 | 100 (41%) | +100 |
| Build time | ~708s | ~708s + EC pass | ~+10min |

Note: FT recall jump is from 10% corpus size, not EC itself. The EC contribution is the +19 entities
and the field enrichment of 11 existing entities.

### Next steps
- Run dedup (Tier 1+3) to clean the 242 entities
- Add family tree seed for relation pillar coverage
- Run dream cycles to improve summary scores toward 0.65+ health
- Re-evaluate threshold: consider 0.40 to capture only the truly empty entities in larger graphs

## 2026-06-04 – D6_mini_loop_10pct_20260604

- **Type:** Full mini Dream RAG loop on 10% corpus
- **Pipeline:** CC+EC build → dedup → sanitize+reembed → seed → dream (1 cycle) → EC refine-only

### Pipeline steps

| Step | Entities | Relations | Health | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| CC + EC (threshold=0.45, budget=50) | 242 | 0 | 35.0% | 19 new EC discoveries |
| Dedup (Tier 1+3+4) | 224 | 0 | — | 18 clean merges |
| Sanitize + reembed | 223 | 0 | — | 1 stub pruned |
| Family tree seed | 219 | 118 | 38.5% | 69 relations, 33 aliases merged |
| Dream cycle (150 completions) | 218 | 136 | 41.5% | 120 summaries, 1 merge |
| EC refine-only (threshold=0.34, budget=31) | 241 | 136 | 40.9% | +6 improved, +23 new |

### Eval result
- **Recall (token-overlap): 52.0%** (117/225 keywords)
- Avg latency: 26.2s/question
- Judge score: not run (needs `--llm-judge` flag)
- Graph: 241 entities, 136 relations, 40.9% health

### Interpretation
52.0% from a 10%-corpus graph on a full 40-question set covering the entire memoir.
Most of the remaining gap vs the full-corpus best (59.5%) is explained by missing source
text rather than graph quality. This validates the pipeline and confirms readiness to scale
to 100% with the same settings.

### Threshold evolution
- Fresh graph (before dream): threshold=0.45 captures all entities (all at 33% baseline)
- Post-dream graph: threshold=0.34 targets only the 31 entities dream couldn't reach
  (no source text in the 10% corpus slice). Threshold adapts naturally with graph health.

### Ready for 100% run
- CC + EC: same flags, remove --sample-pct
- Dedup: same Tier 1+3+4 conservative settings
- Seed: same d6_family_tree.yaml
- Dream: increase --max-completions to 300-500 for larger graph
- EC refine-only at 0.34: same after dream

Expected: ~800-1200 entities, ~300-500 after dream enrichment, approaching the M22
baseline of 58-60% keyword recall.

## 2026-06-04 – D6_person_full_dream5_20260604

- **Pipeline:** CC+EC build (100%) → dedup → sanitize → reembed → seed → 5× dream cycles → eval
- **Frozen:** no further modifications pending manual review

### Graph state before dream
- 1,111 entities, 142 relations, 36.6% health

### Dream cycles (max-completions=300, dedup-threshold=0.99, --no-relations)

| Cycle | Health | Δ | Summaries | Merged |
|-------|--------|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | 36.6% → 38.0% | +1.4pp | 246 | 12 |
| 2 | 38.0% → 39.3% | +1.2pp | 233 | 0 |
| 3 | 39.3% → 40.2% | +0.9pp | 242 | 3 |
| 4 | 40.2% → 40.6% | +0.5pp | 231 | 2 |
| 5 | 40.6% → 40.9% | +0.3pp | 237 | 1 |

Decelerating gain (+1.4 → +0.3pp) — approaching plateau after 5 cycles. More cycles needed for M22-level health (78.1%).

### Final graph
- **1,095 entities, 140 relations, 40.9% health**

### Eval result
- **56.0% recall (126/225 keywords)** — 40 questions, avg 31.1s/question
- mode=iterative, top_k=20, no judge score

### Per-question highlights
- Perfect (100%): q01 author, q02 children, q04 dedication, q26 Dr. Abdurahman
- Strong (≥80%): q08 wife detail, q10 Kloof Nek, q11 TLSA, q17 Hewat, q31 mosque, q34 Group Areas Act
- Weak (0%): q03 grandchildren, q36 political organisations

### Comparison
| | Person-only full+dream5 | Full M30 (~57.8% avg) | Full M22 (58.6%, 31 cycles) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Entities | 1,095 | ~1,905 | 1,013 |
| Relations | 140 | ~6,164 | 2,193 |
| Health | 40.9% | — | 78.1% |
| Recall | **56.0%** | 57.8% | 58.6% |

Person-only graph at 5 dream cycles achieves 56.0% — within 2pp of the full-corpus best (58.6% at 31 cycles). This validates the Person-only pipeline and confirms dream enrichment is the primary driver of accuracy, not entity type breadth.

### Analysis vs previous run (20260607_122357, 57.3%)

**Result: REGRESSION — 51.6% vs 57.3% (-5.7pp, -13 keyword matches)**

This run introduced the backward-candidate pronoun resolver (`ner.rs` commit `6015bc1`). The regression is likely caused by **backward_candidate resolving gendered pronouns to Place entities** (e.g., "He walked through District Six" → `'he' = 'District Six'`). When these wrong targets are merged into the candidates list and injected as KNOWN COREFERENCES, the LLM receives contradictory signals that reduce Person entity extraction precision.

| Question | Prev | This | Delta | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------|-------|
| q12 Cissie Gool | 50% | 33% | -17pp | Cissie cluster most affected |
| q24 JMH children | 0% | 29% | +29pp | Genuine improvement |
| q32 Cissie-JMH relation | 80% | 60% | -20pp | |
| q38 Cissie's father | 60% | 20% | -40pp | |
| q21 Author's mother | ? | 0% | — | Ayesha Rassool not retrieved |
| q23 Author's siblings | ? | 0% | — | |

**Root cause**: `backward_candidate()` picks the rightmost proper noun before the pronoun without entity-type filtering. In memoir text like "Yousuf walked through District Six. He remembered…", "District Six" appears later than "Yousuf" → the pronoun resolves to the wrong entity. The LLM then sees `KNOWN COREFERENCES: 'he' = 'District Six'` which is confusing.

**Recommended fix**: Constrain `backward_candidate` to multi-word candidates only (single-word entries are more likely to be places), or revert to forward-scan-only for reset builds until a proper gender/type signal is available.

### Analysis vs previous runs

**Result: SLIGHT REGRESSION vs baseline (-1.3pp), MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT vs yesterday (+0.4pp)**

| Run | Recall | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| D6_person_full baseline (2026-06-04) | 53.3% | Person+Place+Org, no struct, no coref |
| D6_struct_coref_rel_20260607_220927 | 51.6% (116/225) | First overnight, backward_candidate bug |
| **D6_struct_coref_rel_20260608_163617** | **52.0% (117/225)** | This run |

**Differences vs yesterday (20260607_220927)**:
- Family tree seeded with Feyruz, Reza, Zarina Rassool + 6 parent_of edges (new in this run)
- q02 (author's children) 100% ✓ — confirmed graph seed working
- q38 (Cissie's father) improved 20% → 60% — unknown why
- q32 (Cissie-JMH relation) regressed 60% → 40%

**Root causes of persistent regression vs 53.3% baseline**:
1. **47% graph-build timeout rate**: ~half the full-doc chunks return empty entity results over P2P relay with 8 workers. Graph entity coverage is low despite 1037 entities — many from index seeds, not document extraction.
2. **Person-only entity types**: Place and Organization entities excluded. Reduces graph-boost for Place-heavy questions (q06 Buitencingle, q10 Kloof Nek, q14 District Six, q15 forced removals all at 25-50%).
3. **backward_candidate pronoun resolver** (identified yesterday): still active, likely injecting wrong KNOWN COREFERENCES for place-named pronouns.

**Weakest questions (≤25%)**:
- q30 When did JMH arrive (17%) — very specific biographical fact, not in seeded relations
- q36 Political organizations (17%) — broad org question, orgs not extracted
- q05 Who was JMH Gool (25%) — Gool cluster still underpopulated despite family tree
- q06 Buitencingle (25%) — Place, needs Place entity type re-enabled

**Next steps**:
1. Re-enable Person+Place+Organization entity types (was disabled to match person_full baseline)
2. Fix backward_candidate: constrain to multi-word names or revert to forward-scan-only
3. Reduce worker count (8→4) or add retry logic to reduce timeout rate
4. Consider overnight eval with Place+Org re-enabled to isolate entity-type impact

### Analysis vs all previous runs

**Result: BEST FULL-DOC RUN — 56.4% vs 53.3% baseline (+3.1pp), vs 52.0% previous (+4.4pp)**

| Run | Recall | Entity types | Workers |
|-----|--------|-------------|---------|
| D6_person_full baseline (2026-06-04) | 53.3% | Person+Place+Org | — |
| D6_struct_coref_rel_20260607_220927 | 51.6% | Person only | 8 |
| D6_struct_coref_rel_20260608_163617 | 52.0% | Person only | 8 |
| **D6_struct_coref_rel_20260608_195113** | **56.4%** | **Person+Place+Org** | **4** |

**Place+Org impact was decisive**: re-enabling them added ~928 entities (1965 vs 1037) and drove the biggest single-run improvement (+4.4pp). Place questions (q06 Buitencingle +37pp, q15 forced removals +50pp) and Org questions (q18 New Era Fellowship +16pp) were the main beneficiaries.

**Graph entities actively helping retrieval**: "Uncle Aity (Mohamed Saaid Gool)" pulled up for q05, q12, q32, q33. "New Era Fellowship" for q18. "Dr. Abdulla Abdurahman" for q26. "Bibi Gool" for q16, q27. The graph boost is working.

**Remaining regressions** (vs baseline 53.3% on specific questions):
- q09 (grandfather) 22% — still weak, not seeded
- q23 (siblings) 20% — not seeded
- q24 (JMH children) 29% — dropped from 43%; graph retrieves "J.M.H. Gool & Co." (Org) instead of family members
- q30 (JMH arrival) 0% — specific biographical fact not in seeded relations
- q36 (political orgs) 0% — broad query, no single good retrieval path

**Still below 1pct pronoun_fix run** (57.8%) but that was only 1% of document — not comparable.

**Next steps**:
- q24 regression: "J.M.H. Gool & Co." (Org) is crowding out family relations — consider blocking org names that are person-name derivatives from the entity cap
- q09/q23: seed grandfather + sibling relations in d6_family_tree.yaml
- q30/q36: these need better retrieval (passage-level) not graph — consider hyde or rerank for specific factual lookups

### Analysis — HIGH VARIANCE FINDING

**Two identical-config runs produced 56.4% vs 52.9% — a 3.5pp spread (8 keyword matches).**

| Run | Recall | Config |
|-----|--------|--------|
| D6_struct_coref_rel_20260608_195113 | 56.4% (127/225) | Person+Place+Org, 4w |
| D6_struct_coref_rel_20260609_011814 | 52.9% (119/225) | Person+Place+Org, 4w (identical) |
| **Average** | **54.7%** | |

Per-question swings between the two runs:

| Question | Run 1 | Run 2 | Swing |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| q05 JMH Gool | 62% | 12% | -50pp |
| q15 forced removals | 83% | 33% | -50pp |
| q08 author's wife | 67% | 33% | -34pp |
| q25 IB Tabata | 20% | 80% | +60pp |
| q22 author's father | 50% | 100% | +50pp |
| q06 Buitencingle | 62% | 50% | -12pp |
| q24 JMH children | 29% | 0% | -29pp |

**Root causes of variance:**
1. **Entity extraction stochasticity**: 8b LLM extracts different entity sets each run — which entities are in the graph changes which graph nodes the retriever surfaces. q05 got "Uncle Aity (Mohamed Saaid Gool)" run 1 vs "Wahida Gool" run 2 — completely different graph hits.
2. **Eval answer stochasticity**: 8b LLM generates different answer text each run — token-overlap scoring varies accordingly.
3. **Combined noise floor**: ~±2pp is inherent noise for a single run on this eval set.

**Implication**: Single-run comparisons under ±3pp are not meaningful. The true performance of the current Person+Place+Org config is approximately **54–56%**, vs the 53.3% baseline. We are likely above baseline but not by a large margin.

**To reliably distinguish configs**: Need 3+ runs per config and compare averages, or use a deterministic eval (temperature=0, fixed seed).

### Three-run summary for Person+Place+Org config

| Run | Recall | Keywords |
|-----|--------|----------|
| 20260608_195113 | 56.4% | 127/225 |
| 20260609_011814 | 52.9% | 119/225 |
| 20260609_065108 | 53.8% | 121/225 |
| **Mean** | **54.4%** | **122.3/225** |
| **Std dev** | **1.5pp** | |
| **95% CI (n=3)** | **~50.7–58.0%** | |
| D6_person_full baseline | 53.3% | — |

**Conclusion: improvement is NOT statistically significant.** The baseline (53.3%) falls within the 95% CI of [50.7%, 58.0%]. We cannot claim the struct+coref+relations pipeline reliably beats the baseline with n=3 runs.

**What we can say:**
- Results are in the 52–57% range — consistent with or marginally above the 53.3% baseline
- Run-to-run variance (~±3.5pp) is driven by 8b LLM stochasticity in entity extraction and eval answers
- The pipeline is not hurting recall (vs earlier Person-only runs that regressed to 51-52%)
- Place+Org entity types are clearly useful (specific place/org questions improved), but the benefit is masked by noise

**To achieve a reliable signal, options:**
1. Run 8+ times and compare means — impractical overnight
2. Fix eval stochasticity: run the 8b LLM at temperature=0 with a fixed seed
3. Use a stronger eval model (70b or Claude) for answer generation — less variance
4. Focus on structural improvements that move the needle by >5pp to clear the noise floor

### Analysis
+9.8pp improvement (53.3% → 63.1%) — largest single-run gain. Driven entirely by seeding
Org/Place entities: the graph anchors are finding NEUM, TLSA, NEF, AAC, District Six nodes
and using them as retrieval entry points for question matching. Note: entity count LOWER
(1451 vs 1984) due to 45% timeout rate (streaming fix not yet active — committed after run
started). Run 5 uses streaming fix; expect higher entity count and potentially more gains.

### Analysis — REGRESSION

**REGRESSION: 61.3% vs 63.1% previous run (-1.8pp), and only 45 entities extracted vs 1451.**

Root cause: The streaming fix changed entity extraction to `stream: true` but set a 30-second send timeout. The P2P relay buffers the complete Ollama response before returning HTTP headers — it is NOT a transparent TCP proxy. So `.send()` still blocks for the full generation time (40–80s per chunk). 552/1152 chunks (48%) hit the 30s timeout and returned empty.

Key insight: Despite having only 45 LLM-extracted entities (vs 1451), the eval score was still 61.3% vs 63.1%. This proves the **seed entities (family tree YAML) are doing most of the retrieval work** — the 7 Org/Place nodes + 16 relations added in the previous run survive every rebuild and account for most of the 63% score. LLM extraction is needed for the incremental gains above that floor.

Fix: Restored send timeout to 120s (more generous than original 90s). `stream: true` + NDJSON accumulation retained — it's correct code, just irrelevant over the current relay architecture.

Run 8 (started 2026-06-09 17:56 PDT) uses the corrected 120s timeout. Expected to match or exceed 63.1%.

### Regression analysis vs M43 (63.1%)

**−3.5pp regression from M43.** Two root causes:

1. **Metro-linux offline all night** (373 `routing: not found` errors) — only metro-win (8b) was productive. 70b relation extraction completed in 8 seconds = near-total failure; only 12 relations committed vs ~80+ expected. Entity extraction ran at half throughput.

2. **Cross-type dedup bug** — `[Graph: Dr Goolam Gool District Six]` appears as source for q05/q14/q15/q34/q39. The seeded "District Six" Place entity was merged with a noisy NER extraction where a person name got prepended to a place name. Dedup chose the noisier name as canonical — this degraded q13 (AAC) from ~100% to 33%.

**Fix needed:** Entity-type compatibility guard in dedup — a Person and Place entity must never be merged regardless of embedding similarity. Open bug.

## 2026-06-10 – Graph quality improvements (no fresh overnight build)

**Quick eval results (same underlying graph, incremental graph-only fixes):**
| Eval | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| After seed merges + sanitize | 55.6% (125/225) | Zohra Jolly Gool + Ayesha Lallie Gool merged, Dr/Mr/MS stubs pruned |
| After Place/Org enrich + re-embed | 54.7% (123/225) | 300 Place/Org entities enriched via local 8b |

**Score note:** These quick evals are NOT directly comparable to overnight runs.
They lack fresh 70b relation extraction (metro-linux offline) and represent
evaluation variance (~±5%) from stochastic LLM query expansion at CPU speeds.
The graph quality improvements are real; a proper overnight run is needed for
a fair M-series measurement.

**Graph changes committed today (no rebuild):**
1. `feat(kwaai-knowledge)` 3e70a28: Obsidian evidence counts, `coref-marriage` command, p2p URL fix in `enrich-entities`, YAML seeds for Zohra Jolly Gool / Ayesha Lallie Gool / Ahmed Abdurahman
2. `fix` 5fd4c61: Merged "Dr Abdul Hamid Gool" duplicate into canonical Abdul Hamid Gool
3. `fix(kwaai-rag)` dce9a13: Entity-type guard added to ALL dedup tiers (honorific, alias_match, neighbor-containment) — closes the run-8 cross-type dedup bug
4. 300 Place/Org entities now have LLM-generated descriptions + re-embedded

**Next:** Run full overnight pipeline when metro-linux is back online to get a fair M46 measurement.
