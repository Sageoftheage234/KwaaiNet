# KwaaiNet
[![How Kwaai Democratizes AI in under 5 minutes](docs/assets/hero-video-thumbnail.png)](https://youtu.be/ES9iQWkAFeY)

KwaaiNet is a decentralized AI node architecture for **Layer 8** — the trust and intelligence layer above the traditional network stack — built by the [Kwaai Foundation](https://www.kwaai.ai), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit AI lab focused on democratizing AI.

Each KwaaiNet node combines:

- A **decentralized trust graph** (cryptographic identity, verifiable credentials, local trust scores).
- **Shared, sharded LLM compute** over heterogeneous CPUs/GPUs using Petals-style distributed inference. Apple Silicon Macs use llama.cpp with Metal for 30+ tok/s local inference; Linux nodes use CUDA-accelerated block sharding.
- **Secure multi-tenant knowledge storage** via Virtual Private Knowledge (VPK) with encrypted vector search.
- **Intent-based, peer-to-peer networking** that routes based on "what I need" (model, trust tier, latency), not just IP addresses.

From an app's point of view, KwaaiNet looks like a familiar chat-completion style HTTP API. Under the hood, it is a person-anchored Layer 8 fabric where every node is tied to an accountable human or organization.

---

## Why KwaaiNet?

Today's "Layer 8" — the AI and agent layer that mediates how people see information and act in the world — is mostly provided by closed platforms you rent and cannot inspect.

KwaaiNet offers an alternative:

- **Owners, not renters** — Run intelligent agents on infrastructure you and your community own and govern, instead of renting access to proprietary stacks.
- **Trust-first, not anonymous compute** — Every node carries an Ed25519-anchored identity, W3C Verifiable Credentials, and a local, time-decayed trust score; there is no central trust registry.
- **Knowledge as a first-class, private citizen** — VPK lets you shard encrypted knowledge across nodes and query it without exposing raw content.
- **Intent-based networking** — Nodes route requests based on intents like "model X, minimum trust tier Verified, max latency Y," making the network semantic and economic, not just transport. See [docs/network-and-intent-routing.md](docs/network-and-intent-routing.md) for the full intent lifecycle.

## Project status: where we are now

KwaaiNet is under active development. The Rust CLI and node implementation already ship many core capabilities; others are in progress or still research.

Today, a KwaaiNet node can:

- Run as a native Rust binary (`kwaainet`) with pre-built cross-platform releases.
- Generate a persistent Ed25519 keypair at `~/.kwaainet/identity.key` and derive a stable `PeerId` / `did:peer:` DID.
- Maintain a local W3C Verifiable Credential wallet under `~/.kwaainet/credentials/` with credential types like `FiduciaryPledgeVC`, `VerifiedNodeVC`, `UptimeVC`, `ThroughputVC`, `EventAttendeeVC`, and `PeerEndorsementVC`.
- Compute a local, time-decayed trust score for peers, grouped into tiers (`Unknown`, `Known`, `Verified`, `Trusted`).
- Join a libp2p + Kademlia DHT swarm compatible with Petals/Hivemind for node discovery and health checks.
- Serve and consume **block-sharded LLM inference** (CandelEngine): SafeTensors loading, RoPE, GQA, SwiGLU, per-session KV-cache, and temperature/top-k/top-p sampling, exposed through an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API.
- Run **distributed inference across multiple machines** with session-pinned peer paths that keep KV-caches coherent, automatic gap-filling, and graceful failover when peers go offline.
- Download models selectively with `kwaainet shard download --start-block N --blocks M` — fetch only the weight files needed for your block range (10x reduction for large models).
- **Dual inference backends**: llama.cpp with Metal GPU for 30+ tok/s on Apple Silicon (GGUF models); candle with CUDA for distributed block sharding on Linux.
- **llama.cpp fast path**: when a Mac node hosts the full model and a GGUF file is available, the OpenAI API and benchmark automatically bypass the distributed shard engine and use llama.cpp with Metal — delivering 36+ tok/s instead of ~5 tok/s on CPU. Auto-detected from Ollama, `--ollama-model`, `--gguf-path`, or `~/.kwaainet/models/`.
- **`shard run --local` model reuse** — if `shard serve` is already running on the same machine, `shard run --local` detects the live bypass port and routes through it instead of loading the model a second time, cutting cold-start latency to near zero.
- **Flash Attention (CUDA)** — candle block sharding on NVIDIA GPUs uses a fused QK-softmax-V kernel (`candle-flash-attn`) when built with `--features cuda,flash-attn`, alongside a contiguous KV-cache layout that eliminates strided cuBLAS slowdown. Combined, these push decode throughput toward 30–36 tok/s FP16 on an RTX A5000 (up from ~27 tok/s baseline).
- Pre-form **inference circuits** (`kwaainet shard circuit create`) for stable, reusable peer paths across multiple chat completions.
- Auto-detect local models and network state to smart-select what to serve, and appear on the public map when properly configured at [map.kwaai.ai](https://map.kwaai.ai).
- **Run as a VPK Eve storage node** — initialize an encrypted vector database (`kwaainet storage init --capacity-gb N`), enable VPK mode (`kwaainet vpk enable --mode eve`), and serve vector search to remote Bob nodes over the P2P fabric.
- **Discover VPK-capable peers** with `kwaainet vpk discover` — finds all Eve nodes on the DHT and returns their PeerId, mode, capacity, and tenant count; no IP addresses involved.
- **Benchmark storage performance** with `kwaainet vpk bench` — measures local HNSW vs WAN-sharded Eve vs Qdrant (local or cloud) across multiple corpus scales, with recall and upload-time breakdowns.
- **Inspect live P2P state** with `kwaainet p2p info` (peer ID, observed addresses, NAT verdict), `kwaainet p2p peers list` (active connections tagged direct/relay/bootstrap/trusted-relay with colour), and `kwaainet p2p peers find <peer>` (active DHT lookup) — all talking to the local p2pd over IPC without touching the network except for `find`.
- **Direct peer messaging** — `kwaainet p2p peers send <peer-id> <message>` sends a text message to any connected peer over the libp2p fabric; `peers connect <multiaddr> --message <text>` dials and sends in one step. Relay'd multiaddrs (with `/p2p-circuit/`) are handled correctly.
- **Trusted relays** — configure `trusted_relays` and `force_private` in `~/.kwaainet/config.yaml` so NATed nodes use a specific relay and skip AutoNAT; `peers list` tags trusted-relay connections in gold.
- **IDENTIFY-based public-IP detection** — when no `announce_addr` or `public_ip` is configured, the node polls bootstrap peers for their observed-address reports and restarts p2pd with the confirmed public address automatically. Configurable via `identify_min_confirmations` and `identify_timeout_secs`. `public_port` lets port-forwarded nodes announce a different external port than their listen port.
- **Stable bootstrap identities** — `kwaainet start --identity-key <path>` loads a libp2p-protobuf-encoded key file (RSA or Ed25519) so bootstrap nodes keep the same `PeerId` across restarts; the watchdog restart path honours the override too.
- **RAG knowledge base** — ingest local documents (`txt`, `md`, `pdf`, `docx`, `doc`) into a fully local private vector knowledge base (no network required) with `kwaainet rag ingest`. Hybrid BM25 + dense retrieval, grounded citations, HyDE query expansion with blend control, LLM reranker, semantic paragraph chunking, and an eval harness for accuracy measurement. Supports external drives for large corpora.
- **GraphRAG** — `kwaainet rag graph build` extracts entities and relations from ingested chunks via LLM, storing a persistent property graph (2300+ entities, 2800+ relations on a typical memoir-length corpus). Use `--mode graph` or `--mode auto` on any query/chat/eval command to route through the graph for entity-centric questions. Auto mode hit **46.6% keyword recall** on the D6 eval set (up from 24.6% baseline).
- **Pluggable embedding models** — `kwaainet rag init --embed-model <model>` auto-probes dimension (supports 384-dim all-minilm, 768-dim nomic-embed-text, 1024-dim mxbai-embed-large, etc.). The KB stores the dimension; mismatched models are rejected at query time.
- **Folder sync** — `kwaainet rag sync <folder>` continuously mirrors a directory into the knowledge base, detecting new, changed, and deleted files. Pass `--watch` for continuous mode.
- **OpenAI-compatible RAG server** — `kwaainet rag serve` exposes an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API on port 9090 with RAG baked in. Point OpenWebUI or any OpenAI-compatible client at it as a custom base URL.

See the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet/releases/latest) for the most recent feature list and release notes.

## Quickstart: run a node and make a request

This quickstart shows how to install the native Rust CLI, start a node, and send a simple chat-completion request against its OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

> **Note:** Exact flags and defaults may evolve. Check `kwaainet --help` for current options.

### 1. Install the `kwaainet` CLI

**Shell installer (macOS / Linux):**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet/releases/latest/download/kwaainet-installer.sh | sh
```

**PowerShell installer (Windows):**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet/releases/latest/download/kwaainet-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

**Homebrew (macOS / Linux — optional):**

```bash
brew install kwaai-ai-lab/tap/kwaainet
```

**cargo binstall (downloads prebuilt binary):**

```bash
cargo binstall kwaainet
```

**Nix (reproducible build):**

```bash
nix build github:Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet
./result/bin/kwaainet --help
```

Or enter a development shell with all dependencies pinned:

```bash
nix develop github:Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet
```

See **[nix/README.md](nix/README.md)** for the full Nix guide.

**RISC-V (cross-compile via Nix):**

```bash
nix build github:Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet#kwaainet-riscv64-linux-gnu
file result-kwaainet-riscv64-linux-gnu/bin/kwaainet
# → ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, UCB RISC-V
```

Copy the binary to your RISC-V board and run. See **[nix/README.md](nix/README.md)** for all cross-compilation targets (aarch64-musl, x86_64-musl, riscv64-gnu).

**Build from source:**

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet kwaainet
```

**Build from source with GPU auto-detection (recommended for CUDA machines):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kwaai-AI-Lab/KwaaiNet && cd KwaaiNet
./scripts/build.sh          # auto-detects NVIDIA GPU + nvcc → enables CUDA + Flash Attention
./scripts/build.sh --no-gpu # force CPU-only build
./scripts/build.sh --install # build + cargo install
```

Then confirm:

```bash
kwaainet --help
```

**GPU support (NVIDIA CUDA):**

On Linux and Windows machines with an NVIDIA GPU, the installer automatically detects the GPU and installs the CUDA-enabled build with bundled runtime libraries — no CUDA toolkit installation required. Verify with:

```bash
kwaainet benchmark --gpu
```

**Apple Silicon (Metal):**

On macOS with a GGUF model available (via Ollama or `~/.kwaainet/models/`), the benchmark and API server automatically use llama.cpp with Metal GPU acceleration:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b    # download a GGUF model
kwaainet benchmark         # auto-detects GGUF → 36+ tok/s via Metal
```

To check how many model blocks your hardware can serve:

```bash
kwaainet calibrate
```

This reports GPU name, VRAM, and recommended block counts based on your hardware capacity.

### 2. Initialize and start a node

Initialize node identity and config:

```bash
kwaainet setup
```

This generates `~/.kwaainet/identity.key` (Ed25519 keypair) and creates a default config with a smart default node name (e.g. `alice-linux-aarch64`).

> If `kwaainet start` reports that `p2pd` is missing (e.g. manual install from a `.tar.xz`), run `kwaainet setup --get-deps` to download and install it automatically.

Start the node:

```bash
kwaainet start --daemon
```

The node will connect to bootstrap peers, announce itself on the DHT, auto-detect available hardware, and appear on [map.kwaai.ai](https://map.kwaai.ai). No Python, no build tools, no manual configuration required.

> **Pre-release note (< v1.0):** `kwaainet start --daemon` automatically starts shard serving (if a local model is present) and storage serving (if storage has been initialised). This opt-out default keeps the network dense during the insider phase. Run with `--no-contribute` to start the node without contributing, or permanently disable with `kwaainet config set contribute.shards false`.

## Vision

KwaaiNet is creating a new paradigm for AI infrastructure - one where users maintain complete sovereignty over their computational contributions and personal data. We're building an open-source distributed AI platform that combines:

- **Decentralized AI Compute**: Distributed inference across millions of devices
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: User-controlled data processing
- **Modular Integration**: Support for various storage/identity systems
- **Environmental Accountability**: Carbon-negative computing tracking

KwaaiNet is open-source infrastructure built collaboratively and owned by no single entity.

## Guiding Principles: GliaNet Fiduciary Pledge

Kwaai is a proud signatory of the [**GliaNet Fiduciary Pledge**](https://www.glianetalliance.org/pledge), committing KwaaiNet to the highest standards of user protection. This pledge becomes a foundational principle for the entire network.

### The PEP Model
 

### Node Operator Trust Hierarchy

The GliaNet Fiduciary Pledge is **optional for node operators** but directly impacts network trust:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Trust Levels"
        Pledged[🏅 Fiduciary Node<br/>Signed GliaNet Pledge]
        Standard[📦 Standard Node<br/>No Pledge]
    end

    subgraph "Benefits"
        Priority[Priority Routing]
        Premium[Premium Task Allocation]
        Badge[Trust Badge Display]
        Basic[Basic Participation]
    end

    Pledged -->|Higher Trust| Priority
    Pledged -->|More Rewards| Premium
    Pledged -->|Visible Status| Badge
    Standard -->|Participates| Basic

    style Pledged fill:#10B981,color:#fff
    style Standard fill:#6B7280,color:#fff
```

**Fiduciary Nodes** that sign the pledge receive:
- 🏅 **Trust Badge**: Visible "GliaNet Fiduciary" status on the network map
- ⚡ **Priority Routing**: Preferred for sensitive/enterprise workloads
- 🎯 **Enhanced Reputation**: `FiduciaryPledgeVC` adds 0.30 to the node's trust score (the single highest-weight credential)
- 🤝 **Enterprise Eligibility**: Required for GDPR/HIPAA compliant workloads

The pledge is enforced via the trust graph: signing generates a `FiduciaryPledgeVC` issued by the GliaNet Foundation and stored in the node's credential wallet. The credential travels with the node in every DHT announcement. Violation triggers VC revocation, immediately dropping the node's trust score.

> *"By signing the GliaNet Fiduciary Pledge, node operators commit to putting users first—protecting their data, enhancing their experience, and promoting their interests above all else."*

## Decentralized Trust Graph (DTG)

KwaaiNet implements the [ToIP/DIF Decentralized Trust Graph](https://trustoverip.org) framework — a four-layer model that gives every node a portable, verifiable reputation without any central authority.

### Layer 1 — Identity (already live)

Every node's libp2p `PeerId` (Ed25519 keypair) is a self-certifying identity anchor, functionally equivalent to a `did:key`. KwaaiNet exposes it as a `did:peer:` DID:

```
did:peer:QmYyQSo1c1Ym7orWxLYvCuxRjeczyuq4GNGbMaFfkMhp4
```

The keypair is persisted at `~/.kwaainet/identity.key` so the DID is stable across restarts.

### Layer 2 — Verifiable Credentials

Credentials are cryptographically signed W3C VCs, stored at `~/.kwaainet/credentials/` and included in DHT announcements.

| Credential | Issuer | What it proves | Phase |
|------------|--------|----------------|-------|
| `SummitAttendeeVC` | Kwaai summit server | Attended a Kwaai Personal AI Summit | **1 — live** |
| `FiduciaryPledgeVC` | GliaNet Foundation | Signed the GliaNet Fiduciary Pledge | 2 |
| `VerifiedNodeVC` | Kwaai Foundation | Passed node onboarding checks | 2 |
| `UptimeVC` | Bootstrap servers | Observed uptime ≥ threshold over N days | 3 |
| `ThroughputVC` | Peer nodes | Peer-witnessed throughput within X% of announced | 3 |
| `PeerEndorsementVC` | Any node | "I have transacted with this node reliably" | 4 |

### Layer 3 — Trust Scoring

```
NodeTrustScore = Σ weight(VC_type) × 0.5^(age_days/365)
```

| Score | Tier | Typical credentials |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| ≥ 0.70 | **Trusted** | FiduciaryPledge + VerifiedNode + Uptime |
| ≥ 0.40 | **Verified** | VerifiedNode present |
| ≥ 0.10 | **Known** | SummitAttendee or similar |
| < 0.10 | **Unknown** | No recognised credentials |

Scores are **local to the querier** — your trust graph may differ from mine. A node's earned VCs travel with it if it changes infrastructure. Phase 4 adds full EigenTrust propagation (Sybil-resistant through endorsement-weight decay).

### Layer 4 — Governance

- **Trusted issuers**: GliaNet Foundation (FiduciaryPledge), Kwaai Foundation (VerifiedNode), bootstrap servers (Uptime/Throughput)
- **Revocation**: `FiduciaryPledgeVC` can be revoked if the pledge is violated
- **Enterprise routing**: minimum trust score thresholds for HIPAA/GDPR workloads (Phase 2)

### `kwaainet identity` commands

```bash
kwaainet start --daemon --shard
```

The node will:

- Connect to bootstrap peers and announce itself on the DHT.
- Auto-detect available hardware and serve the optimal block range for your machine.
- Load or download the required model shards.
- Expose an HTTP API compatible with the OpenAI chat-completion interface.

### 3. Call the OpenAI-compatible API

```bash
curl http://localhost:11435/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "your-model-id",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, KwaaiNet!"}
    ]
  }'
```

This sends a chat-completion request to your local node, which may route it through a shard chain of other nodes depending on configuration and trust requirements.

For a full walkthrough including platform specifics, model discovery, and Python/JS examples see **[docs/getting-started-node.md](docs/getting-started-node.md)** and **[docs/api-quickstart.md](docs/api-quickstart.md)**.

### 4. Distributed inference across the network

Download the model (or just the blocks you need):

```bash
kwaainet shard download
```

Run inference across the live KwaaiNet peer network:

```bash
kwaainet shard run "What is the capital of France?"
```

The coordinator discovers block servers via DHT, pins a stable peer path for the session, and forwards activations through the chain:

```
Pinned path:
  [ 1] blocks   0– 23  john-linux-draak-x86_64/v0.3.27
  [ 2] blocks  24– 31  john-linux-draca-x86_64/v0.3.27

  Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.
```

Add `--stats` to see per-token timing breakdown (prefill, decode, throughput). For local-only inference without networking: `kwaainet shard run "prompt" --local`.

On Apple Silicon Macs with a GGUF model (Ollama or `~/.kwaainet/models/`), inference automatically uses llama.cpp with Metal GPU acceleration (36+ tok/s). The shard API also supports this fast path:

```bash
kwaainet shard api --port 8080 --ollama-model llama3.1:8b
```

See **[docs/sharded-llm-processing.md](docs/sharded-llm-processing.md)** for the full architecture of block-sharded inference, KV-cache management, and data flow diagrams.

## VPK Storage Fabric

Virtual Private Knowledge (VPK) is KwaaiNet's encrypted vector storage layer. Bob encrypts vectors locally before they leave his machine; Eve nodes store and search opaque ciphertext. No raw knowledge ever touches a storage node.

### Architecture

```
Bob (any node)                         Eve (storage node)
  │                                         │
  │── kwaainet vpk discover ──────────────▶ DHT
  │   returns PeerId, mode, capacity        │  (no IP addresses)
  │                                         │
  │── /kwaai/storage/1.0.0 ───────────────▶ kwaainet (Eve)
  │   libp2p, Noise-encrypted, PeerId-routed│── redb + HNSW index
  │   CreateTenant / UploadVectors /        │   (multi-tenant)
  │   SearchVectors → {id, score} only      │
  │                                         │
  └── http://127.0.0.1:7432 ─────────────▶ local operator console only
```

Eve returns only `{id, score}` pairs — vectors never travel back over the wire. Nodes are addressed by PeerId; NAT traversal and routing are handled by the P2P relay layer, never by IP addresses.

| Qdrant local Docker | 1.2 ms | 2.8 s |

† 50K spike — likely index-rebuild threshold on the free-tier cluster.

**Key finding:** WAN sharding is RTT-dominated and cannot reduce search latency at any corpus size. 7 of 11 nodes sat at 95–105 ms; every fan-out query pays that floor regardless of shard count or corpus size. Sharding is justified by **capacity** — distributing a corpus too large for one machine's RAM — not latency. LAN-range Eves (≤1 ms RTT) break even at K ≈ 11. PHE-encrypted vectors work equally well on Qdrant; KwaaiNet Eve's unique value is **decentralised, peer-owned storage** with no company intermediary.

### Run as an Eve node

If you run a KwaaiNet node, you can contribute storage capacity to the network:

```bash
kwaainet update                                  # get v0.4.24+
kwaainet storage init --capacity-gb 10           # initialise local vector store
kwaainet vpk enable --mode eve                   # advertise as Eve
kwaainet start --daemon                          # join the network
kwaainet vpk discover                            # verify you appear to peers
```

## RAG Knowledge Base

KwaaiNet includes a built-in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The knowledge base runs entirely on your local node — **no network, no Eve node required**. Documents are chunked, embedded with `nomic-embed-text`, and stored in an embedded vector database. Retrieval uses a hybrid BM25 + dense cosine similarity strategy with lost-in-the-middle context reordering so the most relevant chunks land at the edges of the LLM prompt (not buried in the middle). Vectors can optionally be outsourced to an Eve node on the network for large corpora.

### Quickstart (local, no network required)

```bash
# 1. Pull the embedding model (768-dim, runs locally via Ollama)
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# 2. Initialize a local knowledge base (no Eve node needed)
kwaainet rag init

# Optional: store on an external drive for large corpora
kwaainet rag init --rag-dir /Volumes/WD2/kwaainet-rag

# 3. Ingest documents
kwaainet rag ingest /path/to/document.pdf
kwaainet rag ingest /path/to/report.docx

# 4. Sync a whole folder (incremental — only ingests new/changed files)
kwaainet rag sync /path/to/my-documents/

# Optional: tune chunking strategy (defaults: 800/200/100)
kwaainet rag sync /path/to/my-documents/ --chunk-size 600 --chunk-overlap 150 --min-chunk-len 80

# 5. Hybrid semantic + keyword search (no LLM required)
kwaainet rag query "What are the main risk factors?"

# 6. RAG-augmented chat (streams from your shard API)
kwaainet shard api --port 8080 &
kwaainet rag chat

# 7. OpenAI-compatible RAG HTTP server (for OpenWebUI or any API client)
kwaainet rag serve --port 9090
# → Point OpenWebUI at http://localhost:9090 as a custom OpenAI base URL

# Connect to an Eve node to outsource vector storage (optional)
kwaainet rag connect-eve <PEER_ID>
```

### Document types supported

| Format | Method |
|--------|--------|
| `.txt`, `.md`, `.rst`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml` | Read as UTF-8 |
| `.pdf` | Native Rust extraction (no external tools) |
| `.docx` | Pure-Rust OOXML parser (no LibreOffice needed) |
| `.doc` | `antiword` or LibreOffice headless (must be installed) |

### Folder sync

`kwaainet rag sync` tracks each file's modification time and size. On each run it ingests new files, re-ingests changed files, and (with `--delete`) removes vectors for files that no longer exist.

```bash
# One-shot sync
kwaainet rag sync ~/Documents/research/

# Watch mode — re-syncs every 60 seconds
kwaainet rag sync ~/Documents/research/ --watch --interval 60

# Only specific extensions
kwaainet rag sync ~/Documents/ --extensions "pdf,docx,md"

# Delete vectors for removed files
kwaainet rag sync ~/Documents/ --delete
```

### RAG commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `rag init` | Initialize a local embedded knowledge base (no network required) |
| `rag connect-eve <peer>` | Outsource vector storage to an Eve node on the network |
| `rag ingest <file>` | Chunk, embed, and upload a single document |
| `rag sync <folder>` | Incrementally sync a directory (new/changed/deleted files) |
| `rag query <text>` | Hybrid BM25 + vector search — returns top-K chunks, no LLM |
| `rag chat` | Interactive REPL: retrieve → reorder context → stream LLM answer |
| `rag docs` | List all ingested documents |
| `rag delete-doc <name>` | Remove a document's vectors and metadata |
| `rag serve [--port 9090]` | OpenAI-compatible RAG HTTP server with embedded web UI |
| `rag destroy` | Permanently wipe the knowledge base and all its data |

### External drive support

Large corpora can exceed local disk. Point chunk metadata and cached text at any path:

```bash
kwaainet rag init --eve-peer-id <PEER> --rag-dir /Volumes/WD2/kwaainet-rag
```

The Eve vector store path is set separately at init time:

```bash
kwaainet storage init --capacity-gb 500 --data-dir /Volumes/WD2/kwaainet-storage
```

## Roadmap: destination vs current implementation

KwaaiNet's roadmap is defined as the **gap** between the aspirational Layer 8 architecture in the whitepapers and the currently shipping Rust implementation.

| Area    | Aspirational (whitepapers)                                                                 | Current implementation (Rust node)                                       |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trust   | 5-layer trust pipeline including Testable Credentials (PVP-1) and EigenTrust propagation. | Identity + VC wallet + local time-decayed trust scores shipped; ToIP work in progress. |
| Compute | Sharded inference, decentralized training, safe tool-calling with trust-gated policies.   | Dual backend: llama.cpp for 30+ tok/s local on Apple Silicon, candle for distributed block sharding on Linux/CUDA. Auto-detected GPU with bundled CUDA runtime (no toolkit install needed). Inference circuits, session-pinned paths, selective download, OpenAI-compatible API shipped. |
| Storage | Fully distributed personal AI memory via cross-node VPK sharding and DHT-backed resolution. | **VPK Phase 1 complete**: Eve nodes serve multi-tenant vector storage over `/kwaai/storage/1.0.0` libp2p RPC; Bob nodes discover Eves by PeerId via DHT; `kwaainet vpk bench` benchmarks sharded vs local vs Qdrant performance. **RAG Phase 2 complete**: local-first embedded knowledge base, hybrid BM25 (tantivy) + dense retrieval, brute-force exact search for small corpora (< 2K vectors), lost-in-the-middle context reordering, `rag destroy`, configurable chunking. HNSW tuned to m=16, ef_construction=200 (benchmarked: 97–99% recall on text embeddings at all corpus sizes up to 50K). PHE encryption (Phase 3) is next. See [VPK Shard Benchmark](docs/vpk-shard-bench/README.md) and [HNSW Parameter Study](docs/hnsw_vs_brute_force.md). |
| Network | Intent-casting as a Layer 8 business protocol with economic settlement and neutrality guarantees. | libp2p + Kademlia DHT, trust-gated routing by model/trust/latency shipped. |

See **[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)** for the full living roadmap with contribution ideas for each area.
